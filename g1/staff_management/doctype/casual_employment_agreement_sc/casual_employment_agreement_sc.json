If you&rsquo;re in the national workplace relations system, these protections include minimum pay rates and a set of entitlements called the National Employment Standards. You&rsquo;re also likely to be covered by a modern award or enterprise agreement, which may provide you with more entitlements.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>You might also sign a contract or agreement with your employer.

If there&rsquo;s no modern award or enterprise agreement covering your work, you&rsquo;re still entitled to at least the national minimum wage which, from 1 July 2018, is:</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><strong>$18.93 per hour for full-time and part-time adult employees&nbsp;</strong></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>$23.66 for casual adult employees.&nbsp;</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>The national minimum wage is reviewed annually.

Awards may contain entitlements like minimum wages (pay), penalty rates, types of employment, flexible working arrangements, hours of work, meal and rest breaks, classifications, allowances, annual leave loading, and redundancy.
