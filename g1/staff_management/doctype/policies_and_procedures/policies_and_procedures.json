Once safety is established, the first priority is to care for the client, and they must be given maximum support and assistance.</li>\n<li>Where a client or other Hi Five Community Services stakeholder is subject to any form of verbal or emotional abuse (including racism, discrimination or cultural abuse) from another client, Hi Five Community Services staff will consider terminating the perpetrator&rsquo;s service provision in accordance with Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Rights and Responsibilities Policy and Procedure.</li>\n<li>Any verbal, racism, discrimination or cultural abuse perpetrated by a staff member towards clients or other Hi Five Community Services stakeholders will be dealt with in accordance with the Disciplinary Action provisions in Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Human Resources Policy and Procedure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Responding to Abuse, Assault, Neglect or Unexplained absences</p>\n<p>First response</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the victim requires immediate medical attention, a medical practitioner or ambulance should be called, or the victim conveyed to the nearest hospital emergency department.</li>\n<li>Where a staff member is the alleged perpetrator of abuse, assault or neglect any medical practitioner called should be independent to Hi Five Community Services.</li>\n<li>The staff member who first becomes suspicious of abuse, and/or first becomes aware of the allegation or incident must report it as soon as practicable to the most senior staff member in the work area (where this person is not the suspected or alleged perpetrator). Where the senior staff member is the suspected or alleged perpetrator, the staff member must report as soon as practicable to the Director/s.</li>\n<li>The most senior staff member in the work area present at the time the allegation is made (or the Director/s) is responsible for reporting the allegation of assault to the Police.</li>\n<li>The report must be made as soon as practicable, once immediate safety and medical needs are met.</li>\n<li>The staff member who first suspects abuse or becomes aware of the allegation must be available to assist the Police with any investigation.</li>\n<li>All suspicions, allegations or assaults must be reported to the Directors immediately, or as soon as practicable.</li>\n<li>After reporting to the Police, every attempt must be made to ensure the safety of the victim and to prevent any further contact between the victim and the suspected or alleged perpetrator.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Compulsory reporting to Police</p>\n<p>Where the client:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>is a statutory child protection client;</li>\n<li>resides in out-of-home care;</li>\n<li>resides in a residential service directly managed by the NDIS Commission, such as youth justice custodial services, youth justice residential units, secure welfare, or disability accommodation services;</li>\n<li>receives direct service and supports by a registered disability service provider; or</li>\n<li>has a disability and is receiving in-home or community-based services and the allegation is against a staff member of either the Department or Hi Five Community Services;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And the incident is reportable under the relevant legislation, standards and guidelines and involves allegation of an assault of a:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>client by a staff member or volunteer;</li>\n<li>client by a client;</li>\n<li>client by a visitor, family member, other non-staff member or member of the community; or</li>\n<li>staff member, visitor, other non-staff member or member of the community by a client;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The allegation of assault must be reported to the police, whether or not the client has consented to the matter being reported. The client may choose not to participate in the police investigation.</p>\n<p>Where the client is under 18:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Directors (or delegates) must make a report to Child Protection as soon as is practicable after forming a belief, on reasonable grounds, that:</li>\n<li>a client is in need of protection from significant harm as a result of emotional, physical and/or sexual abuse, and/or neglect, and/or exposure to domestic violence and/or exploitation; and</li>\n<li>the client&rsquo;s parents/guardians are unwilling or unable to protect them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where staff hold a mandatory reporter role, they must report the abuse/neglect to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Police (by calling 000 - if the offence requires immediate police attention; or by calling the local police station); and</li>\n<li>Child Protection authorities, if they suspect, on reasonable grounds, that a child is suffering abuse or neglect, or wish to discuss their concerns about a child.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Advising parties involved of Police report</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In relation to a victim of assault, the staff member or volunteer who first becomes aware of the allegation must advise the person that the allegation will be reported to the police.</li>\n<li>In relation to an alleged perpetrator, staff should consult with police as to whether the person should be told of the report to police. It is important that any steps taken do not undermine action that police may instigate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dealing with the Police</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where an immediate police response is required, call 000.</li>\n<li>The phone call will result in the allocation of the appropriate response unit, which may be a Sexual Offence and Child Abuse Unit / Sexual Offences and Child Abuse Investigation Team (SOCAU/SOCIT) for the area, or a general duties police unit</li>\n<li>If the client is under the age of 18 years, a parent, guardian or independent person must be present if they are going to give a statement.</li>\n<li>At the time of contact, the Police must be advised if the client has an intellectual/cognitive impairment/disability or mental illness and needs support of an independent third person during the interview or when a statement is being taken.</li>\n<li>Where the client uses an alternative form of communication, such as symbols, signs or facilitated communication, an independent third person can usually assist the client to communicate with the police. It is the responsibility of the Police to contact the independent third person.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Contact the local Centre Against Sexual Assault</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Centre Against Sexual Assault (CASAs) operate throughout Vic and provide counselling, advocacy, support and information to adults, young people and children who have experienced sexual assault, whether they were children or adults when the assault was perpetrated. The 24 hour Sexual Assault Crisis Line can be contacted on 1800 806 292 from anywhere in the state and a duty worker will respond.</li>\n<li>In instances of alleged sexual assault, where the client consents, the most senior staff member in the work area should contact the local CAVIC at the same time the Police are informed of the allegation.</li>\n<li>The CAVIC should always be involved unless the client does not want contact with this service. Where the allegation is of sexual assault and the client is examined by a forensic medical officer or forensic nurse examiner, staff must ensure that the client is offered the assistance and support of a counsellor-advocate from the CASA.</li>\n<li>If the client is a person with a disability who does not have the capacity to consent, consent should be obtained from the person&rsquo;s guardian, where possible.</li>\n<li>CAVIC services are free and confidential to all victims/survivors of recent and past sexual assaults regardless of gender and include:</li>\n<li>immediate crisis support including crisis intervention, provision of information, counselling, advocacy, liaison with the department on child protection matters, police, forensic and other medical personnel, and coordination of support</li>\n<li>follow-up, longer-term counselling, advocacy and support</li>\n<li>information regarding options and rights within the legal system</li>\n<li>information regarding medical options, including follow-up medical treatment</li>\n<li>assistance to negotiate the management of sexually transmitted infections and/or pregnancy arising from the assault</li>\n<li>assistance in the management of other practical consequences of the assault such as emergency housing and compensation</li>\n<li>support and information to non-offending family members and support people.</li>\n<li>In addition to the above activities, CASAs also provide community education, training and specialist consultation services to relevant individuals and services to facilitate meeting the broader needs and concerns of victim/survivors of sexual assault. CAVIC can also arrange culturally-specific services for victims from culturally and linguistically diverse communities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Assisting the police</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The police should be assisted in conducting their investigation. The investigation may involve the police taking photographs of any physical injuries. The police may need the carer/worker&rsquo;s assistance to explain this procedure to the client.</li>\n<li>In relation to preserving evidence of sexual assault, it is helpful to:</li>\n<li>encourage the victim not to shower or change, or, if the victim feels they must shower or change, ask them to put the clothing they were wearing at the time of the assault in bags, which should be sealed, labelled and secured and</li>\n<li>where possible, lock the door to the room or restrict access to the area where the assault occurred so any physical evidence inside that area remains undisturbed.</li>\n<li>It is not necessary for a victim to decide immediately about whether to be involved in a police investigation and/or prosecution. People may be distraught in the immediate aftermath of an assault and sometimes change their minds later. Some evidence, however, will only be present in the immediate period following assault. Forensic evidence collected at this time will assist police investigation, should the victim wish to proceed at a later stage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where a client is the alleged victim</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where a client is the alleged victim of an assault, Hi Five Community Services staff must assist them to make an informed decision whether to participate in the police investigation. Staff should advise the client that the matter has been referred to the Police, that the Police may investigate the incident and may want to interview the client and take a statement. The client may choose whether or not to participate in the police investigation.</li>\n<li>Clients with an intellectual/cognitive impairment/disability or a mental illness must have an independent third person present during any interview. The role of the independent third person is to facilitate communication, ensure that the client understands his or her rights, and to support the client.</li>\n<li>Police are responsible for arranging the independent third person. Hi Five Community Services staff should not act as the independent third person.</li>\n<li>Where the alleged victim is under 18 years of age, he or she must have a parent, guardian or an independent person present when a statement is being taken. The role of the independent person is to provide support to the client, and ensure that their evidence is accurately recorded. If the young person has a cognitive disability, then an independent third person rather than an independent person should be present.</li>\n<li>The police will decide whether or not to proceed with charging.</li>\n<li>If the matter is taken to court, the client will most likely be required to give evidence.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Support and advocacy</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The response by staff to a client's disclosure of assault can be central to the client's ongoing safety and their recovery from the trauma of assault. Following an allegation of assault, it is important to:</li>\n<li>listen to and support the client;</li>\n<li>reassure the client that they did the right thing by talking about the assault;</li>\n<li>ensure the client&rsquo;s, and others&rsquo;, immediate safety, health and wellbeing needs are met such as obtaining medical attention and referral to other specialist/victim support services;</li>\n<li>ensure the client's specific support needs are addressed including access to communication aides and resources;</li>\n<li>tell the client what you plan to do next; and</li>\n<li>with the client&rsquo;s consent, engage family, significant others, an independent key support person and/or advocate to support the client and advocate on their behalf.</li>\n<li>A key support person may include a family member, significant other, or advocate who are independent of the perpetrator and/or service. The role of the key support person is to provide support and advocacy, and ensure client&rsquo;s rights are respected in relation to any subsequent investigation or action taken. A key support person should be someone who preferably knows the client well and has their trust.</li>\n<li>Specialist/victim support services may include crisis care, counselling, advocacy, legal information and advice.</li>\n<li>For clients who are from culturally and linguistically diverse communities or from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, staff should consider referring the client to specialist agencies or staff for additional support. It may also be necessary to arrange an interpreter. Appropriate services may include the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporation Family Violence Prevention and Legal Service or the Vic Aboriginal Health Service.</li>\n<li>Where the client uses a language other than English or is deaf, an interpreter of the same sex as the client should be arranged as soon as practicable to interpret for the client, police and other persons involved in the process. Contact the Interpreting and Translating Service.</li>\n<li>Some victims may be reluctant to speak to an interpreter because they fear that what they say may be passed on to their local community. In this case, it is possible to request a telephone interpreter from another state, or to not disclose the victim&rsquo;s name to the interpreter. When using an interpreter directly, consideration should be given to arranging an interpreter who is not associated with the client or his or her immediate cultural community.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Supporting client through the justice process</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hi Five Community Services will support clients through the justice process, including police investigation, prosecution and crimes compensation processes as appropriate. This may include:</li>\n<li>ensuring the client has access to appropriate communication aides and tools to facilitate disclosures and the provision of evidence;</li>\n<li>ensuring the client has access to a key support person of their choosing;</li>\n<li>alerting police to the need for an independent third person or independent person and the client's particular communication support needs, and the need for timely interviews to facilitate the recall of information;</li>\n<li>facilitating arrangements with police for interviews and examination of evidence; and</li>\n<li>facilitating arrangements with specialist support services.</li>\n<li>Under no circumstances should anyone but the Police interview the client about the allegation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where a client is the alleged perpetrator</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Staff must consult with Police about whether to inform the client of the report to Police. The police may want to interview the client and take a statement. Clients with an intellectual/cognitive impairment/disability and/or mental illness must have an independent third person present during the interview, and this will be arranged by police. Where the client is under the age of eighteen years, an independent person must be present during the police interview.</li>\n<li>Staff must contact the service most directly responsible for the client&rsquo;s care who will ensure that the client has legal representation and is assisted during the investigation and hearing.</li>\n<li>Under no circumstances should anyone but the Police interview the client about the allegation.

Hi Five Community Services truly believes in underlying principles of NDIA to offer choice and control to the participants.</li>\n<li>Our policy is that we will not offer core supports or capacity building supports to the clients who receive support co-ordination services from us to avoid any conflict of interest.</li>\n<li>Furthermore, to eliminate any conflict of interest, as support coordinators we will offer at a minimum of 3 service providers to the clients, whether its Core supports or Capacity Building / Capital supports. The client will be given the choice and control to pick the service provider they wish to receive supports from. The client will be introduced to these services providers so they can meet them and understand their services, vision and mission.

It may also be referred to as a National Police Certificate or Police Records Check.</p>\n<p><u>Policy</u></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This policy is applicable to all levels of the staff in the organisation including governing body.</li>\n<li>Hi Five Community Services is committed to building and promoting a diverse and talented workforce that has the support and capacity to deliver high quality services to its clients.</li>\n<li>Hi Five Community Services will employ sufficient numbers of educators, therapists and support staff, taking into consideration qualifications and experience to meet legislative, policy and service standards.</li>\n<li>All Hi Five Community Services Director/s and staff will have and maintain a clear Police Records Check and a Working with Children (WWC) check.</li>\n<li>Directors (or delegates) will ensure that Directors, and all staff and volunteers retain on file a police certificate that is not more than 3 years old.</li>\n<li>Continuity of supports- Hi Five Community Services will endeavour to fill in 100% of the shifts in a scenario where the worker calls in sick or unavailable due to any reason on a scheduled shift. Hi Five Community Services has an agreement with a labour agency company.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><u>Procedures</u></p>\n<p>Recruitment and selection</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If delivering disability support services, Hi Five Community Services staff will meet the minimum qualification and experience requirements set down by the NDIA for the delivery of supports to NDIS participants. Those relevant to Hi Five Community Services are:</li>\n<li>Disability Support Worker: Certificate III, IV, Diploma or Advanced Diploma in Disability Services, or another relevant qualification;</li>\n<li>Nursing &ndash; Enrolled or Registered Nurse. (Australian qualified and registered with AHPRA).</li>\n<li>Hi Five Community Services staff will also meet the minimum experience requirements set down by the NDIA&rsquo;s Guide to Suitability. Currently, Disability Support Workers are expected to have experience delivering person-centred services in the community or in the home and delivering supports to assist people with disability with development of their skills and abilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If delivering disability support, staff will meet the minimum qualification and experience requirements in accordance with regulatory expectations and in observance of relevant standards.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Minimum qualification and experience requirements will be included in recruitment documentation and Position Descriptions.</li>\n<li>Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Directors are responsible for recruiting staff and will:</li>\n<li>develop selection criteria for each position;</li>\n<li>advertise positions, respond to enquiries and email application forms if requested;</li>\n<li>contact applicants and arrange interviews (including interview panels);</li>\n<li>speak with nominated referees and seek opinion about the applicant&rsquo;s qualities, skills and capacity to fulfil the role;</li>\n<li>support selected applicants through the appointment process, including mandatory checks and contract negotiations; and</li>\n<li>notify unsuccessful applicants in writing or verbally, offering feedback on application.</li>\n<li>Selection will be based on merit and have respect to Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Disputes and Grievances and Equity, Anti-Discrimination and Workplace Harassment Policies and Procedures.</li>\n<li>Unsuccessful applicants have the right to appeal recruitment decisions. Appeals should be directed in writing to the Directors and a final decision will be made by Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Management Team. Applicants who successfully appeal will be provided the opportunity for a second interview. Applicants who are not successful in their appeal will be provided advice in writing to this effect.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mandatory Checks</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As a NDIS Registered Provider, Hi Five Community Services must screen new and existing staff, volunteers, students and contractors who work directly with any of Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; clients before they are employed or appointed.</li>\n<li>The mandatory checks applicable to Hi Five Community Services staff are:</li>\n<li>referee checks;</li>\n<li>qualification/s and professional registration checks;</li>\n<li>Disability Worker Exclusion Scheme check;</li>\n<li>the National Police Records Check; and</li>\n<li>the Working with Children Check</li>\n<li>As a provider of services and supports to children, all Hi Five Community Services staff must have and maintain a clear Working with Children (WWC) Check. This requirement applies to all volunteers and students unless they are working under the direct supervision of an educator who is over 18 years of age and holds, or is actively working towards, an approved, Diploma-level education and care qualification. Parent, family members and guardians closely related to children attending the service are exempt from needing a WWC Check.</li>\n<li>The Directors (or delegate) will also check the NDIS Worker Screening Check to ensure prospective staff members are not people who pose a proven risk to the health, safety or welfare of people with a disability.</li>\n<li>The Directors are responsible for:</li>\n<li>determining who will cover the costs of WWC or criminal history record checks;</li>\n<li>ensuring all staff and volunteers and have a current WWC Check, prior to their appointment; and</li>\n<li>maintaining a staff record for all Hi Five Community Services staff including their qualifications, training and criminal history and WWC check status. The Senior Manager must ensure these have been sighted and maintain the details on each staff record.</li>\n<li>The Directors will develop Risk Management Plans for working with people who are aged, people with disability and children. These will be endorsed by Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Management Team and reviewed on a quarterly basis.</li>\n<li>Employment contracts will stipulate that all staff are obligated to:</li>\n<li>advise the Directors (or delegate) if they are charged with a criminal offence which is punishable by imprisonment or, if found guilty, could reasonably affect their ability to meet the inherent requirements of their job; and&nbsp;</li>\n<li>disclose any formal disciplinary action taken against them by any current or former employer. This includes any finding of improper or unprofessional conduct by any Court or Tribunal of any kind and any investigations that the staff member has been subject of by an employer, law enforcement agency or any integrity body or similar in Australia or in another country.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Prior to commencement all prospective staff will be required to sign a statutory declaration that they have fully disclosed all relevant information regarding their criminal record and employment history.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Continuity of Supports</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hi Five Community Services will always have a minimum of two workers trained with each of our clients, so that if one worker is unavailable for any reason, the secondary worker can deliver supports without disruption to the client.</li>\n<li>In a scenario when the worker calls in sick or is unavailable due to any reasons on a scheduled shift, we have a target procedure to fill in 100% of the shifts.</li>\n<li>All staff must notify with minimum 2 hours notice when not available to work for any reason including sickness.</li>\n<li>We have a casual workforce who we will engage to roster on the available shift. If the casual worker is not available, we will contact our labour agency with whom we have a service agreement to supply the casual worker.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rostering</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HR Coordinator updates the roster fortnightly and distributes to workers. Any additional shift will be communicated to workers via phone or text.</li>\n<li>Staff rostered for any High Care needs client will be trained to deliver supports to the specific client they are supporting in the care plan developed for that client. The training will be provided by the RN or a registered RTO.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Student placements</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For students aged 17 years or younger, police checks are not required, however referee checks with teachers, parents or other adults who personally know the students must be undertaken.</li>\n<li>A police check is required for students aged 18 years and older. These checks must be administered by the relevant course coordinator in the educational institute or the student can obtain a police check through the Vic Police website.</li>\n<li>For international students or students who have resided in an overseas country for 12 months or more in the last ten years, as they are only here for a short period, the usual requirement for obtaining an international police check is waived.&nbsp;However, they must complete a Statutory Declaration declaring that&nbsp;they do not have:</li>\n<li>any charges laid against them by police concerning any offence committed in Australia or in another country in the past; or</li>\n<li>any offence of which they have been found guilty, committed in Australia or in another country in the past.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>International police checks</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prospective staff must be informed&nbsp;at the beginning of recruitment processes that if they have resided continuously in an overseas country for 12 months or more in the last ten years, they should contact the relevant overseas police force to obtain a criminal or police record check. If they were a minor when they were overseas, they do not require an international police check.</li>\n<li>Some countries will not release information regarding an individual for personal or third party purposes. In these extenuating cases, where an international police records check cannot be obtained, a statutory declaration and character reference checks must be conducted with at least two individuals who personally knew the individual while they were residing in the other country. This should be undertaken as a very last resort if the international police check is actually unavailable and cannot be obtained.</li>\n<li>The applicant must be informed that referees will be asked whether they have knowledge or information concerning the applicant, which would adversely affect the applicant from performing the job, including any relevant criminal offences. The credentials of persons acting as referees must be verified and can include previous employers, government officials and family members.</li>\n<li>In the case of asylum seekers and refugees who may be unable to provide character references to accompany a statutory declaration, the statutory declaration will suffice with proof of status. However, eligibility to work should be confirmed as part of the recruitment process using the Department of Immigration &amp; Border Protection&rsquo;s ViVic Entitlement Verification Online (VEVO) checking system at <a href=\"http://www.border.gov.au/Busi/Visa\">http://www.border.gov.au/Busi/Visa</a> or their faxback service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Results of the police record check &ndash; NDIS-specific services</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Information released as part of a police record check is restricted according to the relevant legislation or release policies operating in the specific police jurisdiction.</li>\n<li>Where the police record check reveals no disclosable court outcomes, outstanding charges or other matters, their appointment may be confirmed.</li>\n<li>An applicant should not automatically be precluded from a job or placement on the basis of having a police record.</li>\n<li>If providing NDIS-specific services - in line with NDIS Commission&rsquo; Child Protection Manual, if a person&rsquo;s national police history includes a Category A offence, the individual should not be engaged in any client contact role without the written approval of the Director of the Office of Professional Practice and the relevant Department of Human Services&rsquo; Divisional Deputy Secretary.</li>\n<li>In all other cases, the Directors will manage the assessment process in order to determine the applicant's suitability for employment or placement. The Directors (or delegate) will ensure that:</li>\n<li>the applicant, student or volunteer confirms that the details of the disclosable record are correct;</li>\n<li>assessment of the disclosable record of the applicant, volunteer or student is made in accordance with the assessment criteria detailed below;</li>\n<li>before employment is formally offered, a discussion occurs with the relevant Area Director/Regional Senior Program Manager about the intention to employ an individual with such a record. The departmental representative cannot direct or make the decision to employ, but should provide their opinion regarding any decision Hi Five Community Services makes;</li>\n<li>any decision made for or against a person is able to be justified and is fully documented.</li>\n<li>The Directors should give consideration to the following criteria:</li>\n<li>the relevance of the criminal offence, in relation to the job or placement;</li>\n<li>the nature of the offence and the relationship of the offence to the particular job or placement for which the applicant is being considered;</li>\n<li>the length of time since the offence took place;</li>\n<li>whether the person was convicted or found guilty and placed on a bond;</li>\n<li>whether there is evidence of an extended police record;</li>\n<li>the number of offences committed which may establish a pattern of behaviour which renders the applicant unsuitable;</li>\n<li>whether the offence was committed as an adult or a juvenile;</li>\n<li>the severity of punishment imposed;</li>\n<li>whether the offence is still a crime, that is, has the offence now been decriminalised;</li>\n<li>whether there are other factors that may be relevant for consideration; and</li>\n<li>the person's general character since the offence was committed.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Where the Directors makes the decision not to take on an applicant, volunteer or student with a disclosable record, they must:</li>\n<li>inform the unsuccessful applicant of the decision and its rationale;</li>\n<li>provide an opportunity for the unsuccessful applicant to discuss the results; and</li>\n<li>inform the unsuccessful applicant of the opportunity for the decision to be reviewed.</li>\n<li>Where a check demonstrates that a person has a disclosable record, Hi Five Community Services may be obligated to report that outcome to the Disability Worker Exclusion Scheme Unit. See the NDIS Commission&rsquo; website for relevant information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Working with Children Check</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Directors will:</li>\n<li>ensure staff or volunteers issued with a Negative Notice do not undertake child-related work; and</li>\n<li>periodically go to the Department of Justice WWC Check website and check the status of all employees and volunteers with WWC Check cards using Check Status function.</li>\n<li>Staff and volunteers must:</li>\n<li>inform Hi Five Community Services within seven days if they have been issued with an Interim Negative Notice or Negative Notice, or if they have a relevant change in circumstances; and</li>\n<li>not engage in child-related work if they have been issued with a Negative Notice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Storage of documentation and confidentiality</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Information obtained as part of the safety screening process must be treated with the highest level of confidentiality and privacy in accordance with the relevant legislation and standards. See Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Privacy and Confidentiality and Records and Information Management Policies and Procedures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other Checks</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In addition to the Mandatory Checks, the Directors will also confirm the identity (through photo identification), qualifications and professional registrations (through sighting a copy - where relevant) of all prospective staff prior to their appointment.</li>\n<li>If qualifications and/or professional registration/s are a mandatory requirement of the role, original qualifications and/or registration certificate/s must be copied, certified as being a true copy of the original and dated by the relevant delegate then returned to the applicant.</li>\n<li>If there are doubts about the qualification, the Directors should undertake an online check to verify that the qualification was awarded to the applicant. If an online check is not possible, the applicant should provide a letter from the registrar of the relevant institution confirming that the qualification was in fact awarded to the applicant. If there are any concerns about the authenticity of the qualification as presented, the issuing institution must be contacted directly to verify that the particular qualification was completed and issued to the relevant applicant on the date specified.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Training and Development</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Records of induction, training and organisational and professional development provided to all staff will be kept on each staff record as well as in Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Training and Development Register.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Induction</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upon commencement and prior to engaging with clients, all staff will undergo a comprehensive Induction process.

   "options": "<p><u>Purpose and Scope</u></p>\n<p>The organisation adopts a &ldquo;Person Centred Planning&rdquo; approach to underpin its service delivery and support its participants to achieve their goals and get as much as possible out of the service they receive.</p>\n<p>It emphasises not only person-centred planning but also person-centred thinking and person-centred approaches. The focus of this model can be described as &ldquo;nothing about the person without the person&rdquo;, meaning to involve the person directly and as much as possible in the planning, provision and review of their supports, as well as any other aspect of their service and the organisation.</p>\n<p>Alongside that is the belief that the lack of opportunities people with a disability face are more around the barriers society places on them, rather than their own disability. Accordingly, people should not be looked on by their disability, but should be encouraged to reach any dream or desire they may have, and their supports should be focused around both building their skills but also reducing any societal barriers in their way.</p>\n<p>Hence there is much more focus on employment, further education, independent travel, and flexible models of semi-independent accommodation in the sector at present. Just as important and necessary is promoting the wider family and social networks of participants to be involved in their supports and their lives, as a wider collaborative approach has always proved more successful in achieving one&rsquo;s goals.</p>\n<p>Legislation, regulations and standards relevant to this policy and procedure include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013</li>\n<li>National Disability Insurance Scheme (Provider Registration and Practice Standards) Rules 2018 [F2020C00051]</li>\n<li>Disability Inclusion Act 2018</li>\n<li>NDIS Practice Standards and Quality Indicators &ndash; Rights and Responsibilities</li>\n</ul>\n<p><u>Policy</u></p>\n<p>The organisation believes in a holistic approach in providing disability care. Our organisations Person Centred Plan meeting invites the families or friends of the participant. This is an opportunity for our staff to engage with the client and their families. The PCP template has a section on family &amp; friend&rsquo;s interests / occupation; this information will help us in understanding the availability of the families and their interests in specific activities we can engage them in.</p>\n<p>As a policy guideline at the organisation, we engage participant and their family members in taking all the major decisions related to the care and support of the participant. This will result in families being advocating for the participants as well as enhancing participants links with their families and friends.</p>\n<p><u>Communication in client&rsquo;s preferred language</u></p>\n<p>We respect the right of the client to communicate in their preferred language. In the clients intake assessment, client or their legal nominee will be asked of their preferred language for verbal and written communication. Whichever language they prefer will be adapted in service delivery to the client as well as in providing them information and resources in their preferred language.</p>\n<p><u>Procedures</u></p>\n<p>The participant should be involved / in control of the planning process as much as possible</p>\n<p>The person-centred plans should be one year in duration, must be formally reviewed at the six month midway point, and new plans developed on expiry of the old plan.</p>\n<p>As part of preparation in developing new plans, all other participants assessments must be reviewed with management and relevant stakeholders, and updated as required.</p>\n<p>The procedure thus ensures as standard practice all plans, and assessments are reviewed at least annually. Outside of this plans and assessments are reviewed as required, on a case by case basis, e.g. if shorter timeframe is agreed by professionals involved, the participant requests it, the participants needs / supports change etc.</p>\n<p>When setting up goals, the focus should be in the participant being supported to learn new independent living skills, problem solving techniques and related skills development to allow the participant to engage in the above activities with as much independence as possible.</p>\n<p>Staff will support the participant to access any aids, equipment, assessments (e.g. OT, speech, behavioural), or related supports to assist them to build up these skills, including government sponsored courses provided by registered training organisations (i.e. RTO certified / non-certified skills development courses .</p>\n<p>The person-centred planning template is divided into sections, and the above points noted above are covered in the various sections of the template, as prompts for participants and keyworkers to give consideration of these areas when developing the plan, and setting S.M.A.R.T. goals for the participant</p>\n<p>This procedure outlines the person-centred planning process at the organisation, and contains key themes relevant to this topic, in particular.</p>\n<p>- Keyworkers are to develop person centred plans (PCP&rsquo;s), run meetings, monitor and review plan goals, and evaluate them, all with the full / maximum involvement of the participant, letting the participant lead the process as much as possible</p>\n<p>- Likewise, with the participants consent, the PCP process should similarly involve the families and wider circle of support as much involvement in the development, implementation and review of plans, and notes the keyworkers role in ensuring this is occurring</p>\n<p>- Keyworkers are to support participants to access an independent advocate if they choose to do so, or if they do not want / cannot have family members present</p>\n<p>- That unless agreed to by the participant (and management) all plans will be for a duration of one year, with a mid-year review 6 month into the plan</p>\n<p>- All plans will follow the organisations PCP template, which captures additional information such as general health, strengths and weaknesses, interests and fears, long terms goals etc.</p>\n<p>- All plans should contain information on the current goals the participant wants to work on, and the specific supports the organisation will provide to help the participant meet those goals</p>\n<p>- All goals must be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time scaled (S.M.A.R.T)</p>\n<p>- All plans should contain strategies for how participants will be supported to reach their goals</p>\n<p>- All plans will contain information on the participants age, religious, ethnic, gender, cultural and any other practices / observances, and how the organisation will support, respect or observe these in all supports provided to the participant. The development of goals and associated actions must also reflect and take account of these differences</p>\n<p>- All stakeholders, including the participant, are to be provided copies of their completed plans, in a format that they can best understand</p>\n<p>- There must be ongoing assessment and other forms of evidence collected to monitor the participants progress against their goals</p>\n<p>- community access and the active involvement by participants in community activities and opportunities</p>\n<p>- the development of a broad range of independent living skills</p>\n<p>- access to further education and vocational opportunities</p>\n<p>- training in work skills development and access to work opportunities</p>\n<p>- the development and maintaining of friendships and circles of support</p>\n<p>- strategies around maintaining and improving their health and wellbeing</p>\n<p>- assessment and support to overcome any barriers the participant may face in accessing above, with a particular focus on occupational therapy assessment, speech therapy assessment and communication, and behavioural assessment and therapy.

The delivery of safe high-quality services requires effective communication between the client and Hi Five Community Services has a duty to provide language services appropriate to a person&rsquo;s needs.</li>\n<li>Interpreters will be made available at no costs to clients and Hi Five Community Services will promote this in its client information.</li>\n<li>Where it is determined that an interpreter may be required, staff will first assess how well the client can understand information in English. An effective method for assessing English proficiency is to conduct a short, informal interview with the person, asking for basic details about their reason for attending and their background.</li>\n<li>Stressful or unfamiliar environments may affect a person&rsquo;s ability to communicate effectively, even if they generally have a level of proficiency in English suitable for that type of appointment or meeting.</li>\n<li>An interpreter will be engaged if a person requests one.</li>\n<li>Where a client has limited or no English language skills or uses Auslan, Hi Five Community Services will offer the use of a professionally accredited interpreter to ensure the client understands and can communicate in response to the information being provided to them.</li>\n<li>Every reasonable effort must be made to use an accredited interpreter before a family member or friend of the client is asked to assist. They may assist in communicating with a client where an interpreter is required but is not available and a matter must be dealt with in a restricted timeframe. The decision to do so, and the circumstances justifying that decision, must be documented in the client&rsquo;s file or relevant record. As soon as practicable the services of a professional interpreter will be engaged to ensure the information has been accurately conveyed, especially in the case of medical or complex situations.</li>\n<li>Any individual under the age of 18 must never be asked to act in the place of an accredited interpreter.</li>\n<li>Unless they are an accredited interpreter or employed for their language skills, staff members who speak a language other than English may only assist with communicating low risk information such as making appointments or obtaining basic personal details such as name and address. Unaccredited bilingual staff cannot be used to communicate information that is legally binding or puts at risk either the client or Hi Five Community Services. \u2028</li>\n<li>The following are critical points at which people with low English proficiency should have access to information in their preferred language:</li>\n<li>the client is being informed of their rights (e.g. privacy, confidentiality) and responsibilities (e.g. fees);</li>\n<li>the client is required to make significant decisions concerning their lives (e.g. provision of test results, medication regimes, other interventions, undertaking assessment and service/care planning);</li>\n<li>essential information needs to be communicated and understood to inform decision making (e.g. procedures and referral options); and</li>\n<li>giving informed consent (e.g. to treatment, release of information, power of attorney and guardianship matters).</li>\n<li>Hi Five Community Services will access Interpreters and Translators through the Interpreting &amp; Translating Service. Services provided by ITS include:</li>\n<li>telephone interpreting;</li>\n<li>on-site interpreting (spoken languages and Auslan);</li>\n<li>language translations; and</li>\n<li>video remote interpreting.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Clients can request a preferred interpreter. However, while the use of the client&rsquo;s preferred interpreter is recommended, if that interpreter has a qualification lower than a professional level, they can only interpret basic information. A professionally accredited interpreter must be used for the communication of critical or legally binding information.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Information regarding access to interpreters will be published in Hi Five Community Services Participant Induction Handbook and clearly displayed in Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; foyer, along with other information regarding how Hi Five Community Services will deliver culturally competent services. Relevant contact details will be included in Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Referral Database.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Translation</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Translated information can supplement interpreting services and provides information that the client can later refer to, or provide to family, carers and other support persons to aid understanding. Some people may prefer written information.</li>\n<li>Hi Five Community Services will arrange for client information including information on decision making, choice and control, abuse etc. in a language the client is most likely to understand.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Monitoring and Review</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This Policy and Procedure will be reviewed at least annually by Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Management Team and incorporate staff, client and other stakeholder feedback.</li>\n<li>Annual review of this policy and procedure will include:</li>\n<li>a review of service access and support strategies for people from ATSI and CALD backgrounds;</li>\n<li>a review of service involvement and links with ATSI and CALD communities and services;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>satisfaction with the cultural sensitivity of services provided by Hi Five Community Services staff;</li>\n<li>satisfaction with the relevance and quality of referrals and connections provided by Hi Five Community Services staff to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and services;</li>\n<li>client file audits, to assess alignment between documented processes and actual practice;</li>\n<li>feedback from people from ATSI and CALD backgrounds related to the cultural competence of the services provided to them;</li>\n<li>feedback from people on their satisfaction with supports provided to maintain and strengthen their independent life skill; and</li>\n<li>client and other stakeholder awareness of, access to and experience of supports provided to enable them to maintain and enhance links with other people and organisations.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Continuous Improvement Plan will be used to record and monitor progress of any improvements identified and feed into Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; service planning and delivery processes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Endorsement Date: 15 Jan 2020</p>\n<p>Last Review Date: 10 Jan 2020</p>\n<p>Next Review Date: 15 Jan 2021</p>\n<p>This policy and procedure will be reviewed at least annually and changes endorsed by the Management Team.</p>"

Equipment not in use and/or beyond its testing date should have an isolation tag to indicate that tagging is required and must be completed prior to use.</li>\n<li>Testing and tagging of equipment must be done either by a qualified electrician or by someone who has successfully completed an approved course at a Vocational Education and Training provider. There are also a number of electrical contractors who specialise in the checking and tagging of Electrical Equipment.</li>\n<li>Electrical appliances must be inspected and tested:</li>\n<li>at intervals not exceeding those set out by AS3760:2010 (a tolerance of two weeks is acceptable); and</li>\n<li>before being returned to service or after any repair or servicing that could have affected the electrical safety of the appliance.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Manufacturer's instructions may specify intervals appropriate to specific types of equipment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>New Equipment</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brand new electrical equipment that is &lsquo;out of the box' and unused (i.e. new equipment that is not second-hand) does not have to be tested before first use, but should still be visually inspected to ensure that no damage occurred during transport, delivery, installation or commissioning.</li>\n<li>The date when the new electrical item was placed into service should be recorded, if there is no record of installation or similar record. In that case it should also be fitted with a tag that states:</li>\n<li>that the equipment is &lsquo;new to service';</li>\n<li>the date of entry into service; and</li>\n<li>the date when the first electrical safety test is due.</li>\n<li>Any equipment purchased second-hand must be tested and tagged before first use.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Appliances brought in from home</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Electrical appliances brought in by contractors, or from home by staff, clients or visitors, for use on Hi Five Community Services property are subject to the same testing and tagging procedure as for appliances owned or leased by Hi Five Community Services. Appliances should be tested and tagged prior to their use on Hi Five Community Services property.</li>\n<li>While there is no requirement to test and tag personal laptops, staff, clients and visitors are encouraged to have their laptops tested and tagged using an approved person or company.</li>\n<li>In both situations above the testing and tagging is the responsibility and at the expense of the owner.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hire equipment</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While it is the responsibility of the person hiring equipment to ensure that the equipment is inspected and tested at the commencement of each hire, the person or company who hires out the equipment to Hi Five Community Services must ensure that the equipment - for the period of the hire - meets all relevant inspection and testing requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Testing of test equipment</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Test equipment, including leads and probes, must be appropriate and adequate for the tests being performed, and must be suitable for use in accordance with its operating instructions.</li>\n<li>Testing equipment must be in good condition and working order, must be clean and have no cracked or broken insulation, and must be suitable for any voltages that could be found during fault conditions on the equipment being tested. Particular care must be taken with respect to the condition of the insulation on leads, probes and clips of test equipment.</li>\n<li>Instruments such as multi-meters, RCD performance testers, earth loop impedance testers, voltage testers, insulation resistance testers and the like must be regularly tested for accuracy of operation.</li>\n<li>Testing equipment must pose no danger of electrocution to those using it or of damage to the electrical equipment being tested. Test probes and other equipment must be designed and selected so that they cannot inadvertently short circuit between live conductors or live conductors and earth.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The terminals of test equipment should be shrouded and all other test sockets on measuring instruments should be designed so as to prevent inadvertent contact with any live test socket and/or conductor when equipment is in use.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Where appropriate, test leads and testing devices need to be provided with suitable fuse protection. Testing equipment, where used in hazardous flammable areas, must be designed and clearly marked as being suitable for use in such locations.</li>\n<li>Testing equipment used for detecting a live (energised) source should undergo trial operation to prove that it is functioning correctly immediately before and after the test has taken place.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Installation and removal of electrical equipment</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No Electrical Equipment may be installed on Hi Five Community Services owned or leased property unless the work is undertaken by an appropriately licensed electrical installation worker engaged by the Director/s.</li>\n<li>The changing of light globes and lamps have been known to result in electric shock and falls from heights. This work must be completed by a licenced electrician or an appropriately trained staff member or contractor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Managing electrical risks in the workplace</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Before any installation or removal of electrical equipment takes place, hazards associated with the work must be identified and appropriate actions taken to eliminate or minimise them as far as is practicable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unsafe electrical equipment at the workplace</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Director/s will ensure that any unsafe Electrical Equipment is disconnected (or isolated) from its electricity supply and, once disconnected, is not reconnected until it is repaired or tested and found to be safe or is replaced or permanently removed from use.</li>\n<li>To ensure that unsafe Electrical Equipment is not used inadvertently before it can be tested, repaired or replaced, it should immediately be labelled to indicate that it has been taken out of service for safety reasons pending testing and possible repair and to warn against further use.</li>\n<li>Reporting arrangements must be put in place to ensure as far as is reasonably practicable that the Directors are advised if a worker reasonably believes that Electrical Equipment in the workplace is electrically unsafe or that unexpected conditions, for example flooding, render the use of Electrical Equipment in a workplace area unsafe.</li>\n<li>An Incident Report should be lodged when the hazard is discovered and include all details of the incident to enable accurate investigation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Residual Current Devices (RCDs)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The greatest risk of electric shock often results from people making contact with unprotected energised parts of Electrical Equipment and earth. Contact with energised parts may occur by touching bare conductors, internal parts of Electrical Equipment, or external parts of Electrical Equipment that have become energised because of an internal fault.</li>\n<li>Workplace fatalities can be prevented by the use of properly installed and maintained RCDs, commonly referred to as &lsquo;safety switches'. An RCD is an electrical safety device designed to immediately switch off the supply of electricity when electricity &lsquo;leaking' to earth is detected at harmful levels. RCDs offer high levels of personal protection from electric shock.</li>\n<li>RCDs also reduce the risk of fire by detecting electrical leakage to earth in electrical wiring and Electrical Equipment. This protection is particularly important for older electrical installations.</li>\n<li>For new electrical installations, RCDs must be installed in the switchboard by a licensed Electrical Installation worker.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Certificates of electrical safety</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On completion of any electrical installation work undertaken on Hi Five Community Services premises, a certificate of electrical safety must be issued by the electrical contractor who undertook the work. No electrical installation work should be commenced unless the contractor concerned is authorised and willing to issue such a certificate.</li>\n<li>Testing shall include mandatory and optional tests as applicable to the required works.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Inspection and testing</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In some instances, electrical installation work must be inspected by a licensed electrical safety inspector before the certificate of electrical safety can be finalised. The electrical contractor undertaking the installation work will be able to advise if an inspection is required and arrange for an inspector to undertake it.</li>\n<li>An electrical installation, or any part thereof, that has been constructed, altered, added to or repaired must not be put into service until:</li>\n<li>the certificate of electrical safety has been issued and the installation inspected if required; and</li>\n<li>the installation has been tested and the electrical contractor has verified that the alteration, addition or repair is compliant with AS3000 (Electrical installations) and does not impair the safety and integrity of any existing electrical installation.</li>\n<li>For major construction works all parts of the electrical installation will be inspected and certified by an independent and qualified electrical inspector. Self-certification by the installation contractor is not acceptable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Inspecting and testing of RCDs</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Director/s will ensure that all RCDs used at the workplace are tested regularly by a competent person to ensure the devices are working effectively. This requirement applies to all RCDs, including non-portable RCDs, used in all operating environments.</li>\n<li>A record of testing must be kept until the device is next tested or disposed of.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Operation and Maintenance Manuals</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For all new installations and equipment, the contractor is to provide Operating and Maintenance Manuals in line with the Minimum Level Design and Construction Specifications.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Portable electrical equipment</p>\n<p>Ensuring the safe use of portable Electrical Equipment</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are a number of things that must be done to help ensure the safe use of portable Electrical Equipment in the workplace including:</li>\n<li>using only portable Electrical Equipment that is recommended under this procedure (see below);</li>\n<li>visually inspecting new equipment to ensure that no damage has occurred during transport, delivery, installation or commissioning;</li>\n<li>arranging electrical leads so they will not be damaged - avoiding running leads across the floor or ground, through doorways and over sharp edges, and using lead stands or insulated cable hangers to keep leads off the ground; and</li>\n<li>not using leads and tools in damp or wet conditions unless they are specially designed for these conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Risk management</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If it is believed there might be a hazard to health or safety associated with the use of the portable equipment, the risk must be identified and action taken to eliminate it, or minimise it so far as is practicable. See Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Risk Management Policy and Procedure.</li>\n<li>Any hazard or injury resulting from the use of portable Electrical Equipment must be reported immediately using Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Incident Report.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unsafe portable Electrical Equipment at the workplace</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Director/s will ensure that any unsafe Electrical Equipment at the workplace is disconnected or locked out (or isolated) from its electricity supply, and, once disconnected, is not reconnected until it is repaired or tested and found to be safe or is replaced or permanently removed from use.</li>\n<li>To ensure that unsafe Electrical Equipment is not used inadvertently before it can be tested, repaired or replaced, it should be labelled to indicate that it has been taken out of service for safety reasons pending testing and possible repair and to warn against further use.</li>\n<li>Reporting arrangements must be put in place to ensure as far as is reasonably practicable that the Directors are advised if a worker reasonably believes that portable Electrical Equipment in the workplace is electrically unsafe or that unexpected conditions (e.g. flooding), render the use of portable Electrical Equipment in a workplace area unsafe.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>RCDs</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Workplace fatalities can be prevented by the use of properly installed and maintained RCDs - commonly referred to as &lsquo;safety switches'.</li>\n<li>While RCDs significantly reduce the risk of electric shock they do not provide protection in all circumstances. For example, an RCD will not isolate an electricity supply if a person contacts both active and neutral conductors while handling faulty plugs or electrical equipment with the result that electricity flows through the body, unless there is also a current flow to earth.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When RCDs must be provided for use in workplaces</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where practicable, appropriate RCDs should be used to minimise any electrical hazard associated with the supply of electricity to &lsquo;plug in' electrical equipment. In the following higher-risk workplaces use of RCDs is required where:</li>\n<li>the normal use of Electrical Equipment exposes the equipment to operating conditions that are likely to result in damage to the equipment or a reduction in its expected life span, including conditions that involve exposure to moisture, heat, vibration, mechanical damage, corrosive chemicals or dust;</li>\n<li>Electrical Equipment is moved between different locations in circumstances where damage to the equipment or to a flexible electricity supply cord is reasonably likely;</li>\n<li>Electrical Equipment is frequently moved during its normal use;</li>\n<li>Electrical Equipment forms part of, or is used in connection with, an amusement device; and</li>\n<li>a circuit supplies a wet use appliance, if practicable.</li>\n<li>Common examples of Electrical Equipment that may be used in these operating conditions, and therefore should use RCDs, include:</li>\n<li>hand-held Electrical Equipment (e.g. drills, saws, hair dryers and electric knives);</li>\n<li>Electrical Equipment that is moved while in operation (e.g. jackhammers, electric lawn mowers, vacuum cleaners, floor polishers and extension cords) ; and</li>\n<li>Electrical Equipment that is moved between jobs in ways that could result in damage to the equipment (e.g. electric welders, electric cement mixers, portable bench saws and extension cords).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Non-portable (or &lsquo;fixed') RCDs</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Non-portable RCDs are RCDs installed at either the switchboard or a fixed socket outlet. For new installations the Minimum Level Design and Construction Specifications state that when an RCD is installed it is installed in the switchboard.</li>\n<li>Fixed RCDs must be installed by an appropriately licensed electrical installation worker engaged by the Directors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Portable RCDs</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Portable RCDs are usually plugged into a Socket Outlet and (depending on design) may protect one or more items of Electrical Equipment.</li>\n<li>The Directors must take all reasonable steps to ensure that portable RCDs used at the workplace are tested according to AS 3760:2010 by an appropriately licensed electrical installation worker to ensure the devices are working effectively.</li>\n<li>If an RCD is tested and found to be faulty it should be taken out of service immediately and arrangements made for its immediate replacement.</li>\n<li>A record of testing will be provided and must be kept on the device until it is next tested or disposed of.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Use of portable Electrical Equipment on Hi Five Community Services Premises</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The use of double adaptors is not permitted within Hi Five Community Services and should be removed and replaced with EPODs (power boards) fitted with overload protection devices.</li>\n<li>Power boards are to be used only if they have overload protection. Home-made EPODs are illegal throughout Australia and must not be used at Hi Five Community Services.</li>\n<li>If an integral part of an electrical appliance or rack, and EPOD shall be fixed by the use of secure fittings in such a way that the face is in the vertical plane in a location that is not susceptible to mechanical or water damage. Where possible the cord should be fixed to reduce the weight on the EPOD electrical junction.</li>\n<li>Each EPOD must be plugged into a general purpose outlet (GPO). GPOs share power circuits. Be aware too many EPODs plugged into GPOs on the same circuit may overload the circuit and cause a power failure.</li>\n<li>Extension leads are only suitable for temporary applications. For longer term applications a new GPO should be installed or an EPOD with overload protection used. Ensure the extension lead is placed appropriately and shielded with an appropriate extension lead cover to reduce tripping hazards. Be wary of heavy equipment rolling over or impacting the lead as it may damage the insulation and wires causing shorting.</li>\n<li>The use of fan forced coil heaters is not permitted; these devices pose a high fire risk and consume a great amount of energy. They are often not fitted with a cut-off switch and have relatively exposed elements making them susceptible to trapping dust and debris. Where a building has insufficient heating, Hi Five Community Services will permit the use of convective panel heaters. Be aware that too many panel heaters on the same circuit may overload the circuit and cause a power failure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hazard and incident reporting</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All hazards and injuries relating to electrical safety must be reported immediately in accordance with Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Incident Management Policy and Procedure.</li>\n<li>Most electrical shocks constitute a notifiable incident and must be dealt with in accordance with Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Incident Management Policy and Procedure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Monitoring and Review</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This policy and procedure will be reviewed at least annually by Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Management Team. This process will include a review and evaluation of: current practices and service delivery types and locations; the Incident Register; policies and procedures; the Complaints and Grievances Register; and, will incorporate staff, client and other stakeholder&rsquo;s feedback.</li>\n<li>Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Continuous Improvement Plan will be used to record and monitor progress of any improvements identified and where relevant feed into Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; service planning and delivery processes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Endorsement Date: 15 Jan 2020</p>\n<p>Last Review Date: 10 Jan 2020</p>\n<p>Next Review Date: 15 Jan 2021</p>\n<p>This policy and procedure will be reviewed at least annually and any proposed changes approved by the Management Team.</p>"

Contaminated areas such as operating rooms or isolation rooms must be cleaned after each session, and spot cleaned after each case or thoroughly cleaned as necessary.</p>\n<p>The following basic principles should be followed:</p>\n<p>Written cleaning protocols should be prepared, including methods and frequency of cleaning; protocols should include policies for the supply of all cleaning and disinfectant products</p>\n<p>standard precautions (including wearing of personal protective equipment [PPE], as applicable) should be implemented when cleaning surfaces and facilities (see &lsquo;Standard and additional precautions&rsquo;)</p>\n<p>cleaning methods should avoid generation of aerosols</p>\n<p>All cleaning items should be changed after each use and cleaned and dried before being used again. They should also be changed immediately following the cleaning of blood or body fluid/substance spills. Single-use cleaning items are preferred, where possible, such as lint-free cleaning cloths</p>\n<p>sprays should not be used, because they can become contaminated and are difficult to clean. Sprays are not effective, as they do not touch all parts of the surface to be cleaned</p>\n<p>detergents should not be mixed with other chemicals</p>\n<p>all cleaning solutions should be prepared fresh before use.</p>\n<p><u>Cleaning &ndash; specific procedures</u></p>\n<p>Surface cleaning</p>\n<p>Floors in hospitals and day-care facilities should be cleaned daily or, as necessary, with a vacuum cleaner fitted with a particulate-retaining filter. The filter should be changed in accordance with the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions.</p>\n<p>The exhaust air should be directed away from the floor to avoid dust dispersal.</p>\n<p>A ducted vacuum cleaning system can also be used, as long as safe venting of the exhaust air is ensured.</p>\n<p>Damp dusting using a lint-free cloth is essential. Brooms disperse dust and bacteria into the air, and should not be used in patient or clinical areas. Dust-retaining mops, which are specially treated or manufactured to attract and retain dust particles, do not increase airborne counts as much as ordinary brooms and remove more dust from surfaces. However, brooms and dust-retaining mops should not be used in clinical areas where there is a high risk of infection associated with dust (for example, burns units).</p>\n<p>The procedure for routine surface cleaning is as follows:</p>\n<p>All cleaning solutions should be prepared immediately before use.</p>\n<p>Work surfaces should be cleaned (wiped over) with a neutral detergent and warm water solution, rinsed and dried before and after each session, or when visibly soiled. Spills should be cleaned up as soon as practical.</p>\n<p>When a disinfectant is required for surface cleaning, the manufacturer&rsquo;s recommendations for use, and workplace health and safety instructions should be followed.</p>\n<p>Buckets should be emptied after use, washed with detergent and warm water, rinsed in hot water and stored dry (turned upside down).</p>\n<p>Mops should be laundered or cleaned in detergent and warm water, rinsed in hot water, then stored dry. Mop heads should be detachable or stored with the mop head up.</p>\n<p>Specialized areas</p>\n<p>Isolation rooms and ensuite bathrooms should be cleaned at least twice daily, depending on the type of microorganism.</p>\n<p>Operating rooms and day procedure rooms, including endoscopy rooms, should be cleaned after each operating session and when visibly soiled.

Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Authorised Program Officer is Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Directors.</p>\n<p>Behaviours of concern - any behaviour by a person using Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; services which could cause physical harm to themselves or other people, or which could cause property damage that could lead to themselves or other people being hurt.</p>\n<p>Behaviour Support Plan - A plan developed for a person with a disability that specifies a range of strategies to be used in supporting the person's behaviour, including proactive strategies to build on the person's strengths and increase their life skills. Any person who is subjected to restraint and/or seclusion in disability services must have an approved Behaviour Support Plan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Restrictive intervention &ndash; defined by the relevant legislation as any intervention that is used to restrict the rights or freedom of movement of a person with a disability including chemical, mechanical, physical restraint, and seclusion. The legislation also refers to other restrictive interventions, which include, but are not limited to, environmental restraint, psycho-social restraint and consequence-driven strategies.</p>\n<p>Chemical restraint - the use, for the primary purpose of the behavioural control of a person with a disability, of a chemical substance to control or subdue the person. Does not include the use of a drug prescribed by a registered medical practitioner for the treatment, or to enable the treatment, of a mental illness or a physical illness or physical condition.</p>\n<p>Mechanical restraint - the use, for the primary purpose of the behavioural control of a person with a disability, of devices to prevent, restrict or subdue a person's movement. Does not include the use of devices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>for therapeutic purposes; or</li>\n<li>to enable the safe transportation of the person.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Seclusion - the sole confinement of a person with a disability at any hour of the day or night:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in any room in the premises where disability services are being provided of which the doors and windows cannot be opened by the person from the inside; or</li>\n<li>in any room in the premises where disability services are being provided of which the doors and windows are locked from the outside; or</li>\n<li>to a part of any premises in which disability services are being provided.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Senior Practitioner &ndash; in accordance with the relevant legislation, this is the person appointed by the relevant Government to ensure that people&rsquo;s rights are protected and that service providers follow legislative and practice standards any time restrictive interventions are used.</p>\n<p>Detention - a situation where a person who wishes to do so is actively prevented from leaving the place where they receive disability services. Detention may include locked doors, windows or gates, and the constant supervision and escorting of a person to prevent them from exercising freedom of movement.</p>\n<p>Environmental restraint &ndash; the prevention, including but not limited to the use of physical or other barriers, of a person&rsquo;s free access to all parts of their environment for the purpose of influencing or controlling that person&rsquo;s behaviour. This includes locking cupboard and doors, being prevented access to anything in the kitchen and restrictions to personal items, locks being used that a person has difficulty accessing or cannot self-operate, and restrictions to engaging in social activities (such as a person not being supported to leave the house when they wants to, regardless of operational demands).</p>\n<p>Exclusion - the act of preventing a person from participating in or being part of an activity or decision, or deliberately ignoring or not including a person in an activity or decision.</p>\n<p>Guardian - a person appointed as guardian of an adult by legal order of the relevant state institution, usually where a person has been deemed as having impaired decision-making capacity. A guardian is responsible for making decisions on behalf of a person about accommodation and/or health care and/or lifestyle matters and/or restrictive interventions.</p>\n<p>Impaired decision-making capacity refers to the inability of a person to make a particular decision at a particular time because he or she is incapable of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>understanding any information that may be relevant to the decision; or</li>\n<li>retaining such information; or</li>\n<li>using such information in the course of making the decision; or</li>\n<li>communicating his or her decision in any manner; or</li>\n<li>by reason of being comatose or otherwise unconscious, is unable to make a particular decision about his or her medical treatment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Substitute decision-maker - an adult appointed under a Gentle Care Support Service directive who can make decisions about health care, end of life, living arrangements and other personal matters on behalf of a person during a period of impaired decision-making capacity, whether for a short time or permanently. In this policy, it includes substitute decision-makers appointed under the former Enduring Power of Guardianship and Medical Power of Attorney.</p>\n<p>Mechanical restraint - the use of a device to prevent, restrict or subdue a person&rsquo;s free movement for the primary purpose of influencing or controlling that person&rsquo;s behaviour. Mechanical restraint does not include the use of devices for therapeutic purposes (eg splints) or for safety purposes not primarily related to behaviour (eg seat belts, bed rails to prevent injury from falls, devices to enable the safe transportation of a person). However, a therapeutic or safety device is considered a mechanical restraint if a person resists or objects to its use, or if it prevents free movement upon its use for safety or therapeutic services ceasing (ie where a bed rail prevents a person from getting out of bed as soon as they want to).</p>\n<p>Physical restraint - the use of any part of a person&rsquo;s body to prevent, restrict or subdue free movement of another person&rsquo;s body for the primary purpose of controlling that person&rsquo;s behaviour. Physical restraint does not include brief physical contact to guide or redirect a person away from immediate potential harm or injury consistent with a service provider&rsquo;s duty of care to that person or physical assistance with activities of daily living. This type of restraint can only be used as a planned response in emergency situations, and is not to be used as a part of a person&rsquo;s routine behaviour support.</p>\n<p>PRN medication (PRN - &lsquo;pro-re-nata&rsquo;) - medication that is given as needed or as the situation arises (i.e. the times of administration are determined by the needs of the person and not given at scheduled times, e.g. analgesia for pain or fever). PRN may be considered as being a chemical restraint (see definition of chemical restraint).</p>\n<p>Psycho-social restraint &ndash; the use of power-control strategies to influence a person&rsquo;s behaviour. This includes but is not limited to directing the person&rsquo;s behaviour through voice tone, commands or threats and the use of punishment, including ignoring the person and withholding basic human rights, such as positive social interaction, personal belongings or a favoured activity. It also includes directions to: stay in one area of the house or the use of &lsquo;exclusionary time-out&rsquo;; and remain in a particular position, and the over-correction of errors.</p>\n<p>Restrictive practices - any practice, device or action that removes or restricts another person&rsquo;s freedom, movement or ability to make a decision. This includes, but is not limited to, detention, seclusion, exclusion, aversive restraint, chemical restraint, physical restraint, mechanical restraint, environmental restraint, psycho-social restraint and the consequence-driven strategies. Restrictive practices do not include therapeutic or safety devices/practices, where the device or practice is being used for its intended purpose and the person is not resisting or objecting to its use.</p>\n<p>Safety device/practice - a device or practice used for safety purposes not primarily related to behaviour (e.g. lap belts or bed rails to prevent accidental falls or devices to enable the safe transportation of a person). This also includes environmental modifications for safety purposes, such as sensor mats and &lsquo;Walkabout&rsquo; alarms.</p>\n<p>Therapeutic device/practice - a device or practice recommended by an appropriate health practitioner for the purpose of maintaining or restoring health or for the treatment of an illness or condition (e.g. splints).</p>\n<p><u>Policy</u></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hi Five Community Services promotes the dignity, worth, rights and developmental potential of people with a disability.

Strategies include:</li>\n<li>inclusive, person-centred approaches in all instances of support;</li>\n<li>proactively preventing behaviours of concern occurring in the first place;</li>\n<li>working to the primary goal of enhancing the quality of life of a person and a secondary goal of reducing behaviours of concern;</li>\n<li>taking into consideration the context in which any behaviours of concern occur and the environments in which the person lives;</li>\n<li>seeing the person&rsquo;s strengths and being committed to the person&rsquo;s potential;</li>\n<li>valuing the person and seeing the behaviour in context;</li>\n<li>an appreciation that all behaviours have a purpose; and</li>\n<li>being positive.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Hi Five Community Services Directors (or delegates) will discuss how best to manage behaviours of concern with the client and their supporter/s.</li>\n<li>In managing behaviour, staff will always use the least restrictive alternative. Any action taken to benefit a client should intrude as little as possible on their rights and lifestyle.</li>\n<li>Restrictive interventions, including those that constitute environmental restraint, psycho-social restraint, consequence-driven strategies or exclusion are inconsistent with rights-based and person-centred service delivery to people with disability and must not be recommended or used in any circumstances, unless used in accordance with relevant legislation.</li>\n<li>Staff will implement Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; NDIS Assessment, Planning and Review Policy and Procedure consistent with this policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Individual Behaviour Support Plans</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The plans of people subject to restrictive interventions must include (but should not be limited to) the following key quality elements in relation to positive behaviour support:</li>\n<li>The plan identifies the function of the behaviours of concern</li>\n<li>Environmental factors that trigger or support the behaviours of concern are identified</li>\n<li>The plan introduces environmental change and supports positive behaviour</li>\n<li>Reinforcement schedules relating to positive behaviour</li>\n<li>Description of the response to recurrence of behaviours of concern</li>\n<li>A strategy to communicate between relevant persons.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Hi Five Community Services may seek the expertise of psychologists and/or developmental educators and/or other allied health professionals in the development and implementation of individual support plans, in accordance with relevant legislative requirements.</li>\n<li>An appropriate individual behaviour support plan must be in place before a restrictive practice is recommended.</li>\n<li>Directors (or delegates) are to be advised and trained in the individual support plan, which must be readily available in the person&rsquo;s file for ongoing use by staff when required.</li>\n<li>Hi Five Community Services is required to ensure that a person&rsquo;s specific consent and/or authorisation arrangements, including the details of a person&rsquo;s substitute decision-maker or guardian, or any orders by the relevant Public Guardianship authority are clearly documented to inform Directors (or delegates) about arrangements relating to the use of restrictive practices.</li>\n<li>Disability service providers are responsible for accurate recording and reporting of the use of restrictive practices. This includes:</li>\n<li>Maintaining a register of all people who have an individual support plan that includes the use of restrictive practices;</li>\n<li>Recording each use of a restrictive practice; and&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Recording each use of a restrictive practice in an emergency.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Restrictive Interventions</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hi Five Community Services in principle does not support the use of restrictive interventions.</li>\n<li>Restrictive interventions restrict the liberty of individuals and should be considered only in exceptional circumstances where a person is at imminent risk of causing physical harm to themselves or others (including harm to self or others through the destruction of property), and all other reasonable, less restrictive alternatives have been used. In these rare instances, the use of restrictive interventions must be an option of last resort. It must be time-limited, based on best practice, applied in line with the relevant legislative requirements and be the least restrictive option available in the situation.</li>\n<li>Should Hi Five Community Services need to implement restrictive interventions, the organisation will uphold its obligations in accordance with the relevant legislation. This includes consultation with the client, their supporter/s and other key stakeholders, including appointed decision makers, to develop a Behaviour Support Plan prior to the use of any restrictive interventions</li>\n<li>The use of a restrictive interventions within Hi Five Community Services requires the following:</li>\n<li>Comprehensive bio-psychosocial assessment;</li>\n<li>Recommendation of the restrictive intervention by an appropriate professional, within the context of a holistic individual behaviour support plan for the person with disability, in line with legislative requirements;</li>\n<li>Informed consent by a person with legal authority;</li>\n<li>Where required, authorisation by the relevant government institution;</li>\n<li>Application of the restrictive intervention only by appropriately trained and competent disability services staff, to the extent legally authorised; and</li>\n<li>Regular review of the use of the restrictive interventions as part of individual support planning with the person, in accordance with timeframes set out in relevant legislation.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Within Hi Five Community Services, the use of a restrictive practice requires recommendation by:</li>\n<li>a practitioner, being a medical practitioner, relevant health professional or manager of the relevant service unit or area; and</li>\n<li>Directors, and</li>\n<li>Any other appropriate person, according to legislative requirements.</li>\n<li>The primary focus of any Behaviour Support Plan will be to improve the quality of life of the client, with a secondary focus on eliminating or reducing behaviours of concern. Restrictive interventions approved for use, will be used only:</li>\n<li>when necessary to prevent the person from causing physical harm to themselves or others (including harm to self or others through the destruction of property);</li>\n<li>in a way that is least restrictive;</li>\n<li>as a last resort;</li>\n<li>in accordance with the individual&rsquo;s behaviour support plan;</li>\n<li>applied for the period of time that has been authorised; and</li>\n<li>in accordance with all relevant legislative requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>For each client that restrictive interventions apply to, the restrictive practices will not be implemented until that client&rsquo;s Behaviour Support Plan is approved by the Authorised Program Officer and until the client subject to the restrictive interventions has been notified in writing at least two days prior to the proposed use of the practices, except in the case of an emergency.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Notification will be in an accessible communication format for the client and advise that a restrictive intervention has been approved for use and under what conditions. Clients subject to restrictive intervention and their supporters will be made aware of the reasons restrictive interventions may be implemented and when and how this will be reviewed. In accordance with relevant legislation, an independent person must be availed of to complete this task.</li>\n<li>Before any restrictive intervention is used, the Director (or delegates) will ensure the person exhibiting behaviours of concern and their supporter/s (if applicable), understand they have the right to appeal to the relevant authority if they do not agree with the intervention.</li>\n<li>If a client does not have a supporter or guardian and is unable to advocate for themselves, staff will make sure the person is supported to access an advocate (see Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Decision Making and Choice Policy and Procedure).</li>\n<li>Restrictive interventions will not be used until such time that Hi Five Community Services have procedures in place that detail the specific application of the restriction (e.g. specific procedures as to how physical restraint will be safely and legally applied in the relevant setting).</li>\n<li>No individual will apply a restriction without the appropriate training in the safe use of the restriction, the legal framework and obligations, and the risks posed by the use of the restriction. The Director (or delegates) must be satisfied of staff&rsquo;s competence in the practice prior to its use.</li>\n<li>Any use of a restrictive intervention must be approved by the Directors (or delegates), the Authorised Program Officer and any other relevant person in accordance with the legislative requirements, except in situations where there is significant risk of someone being harmed.</li>\n<li>If a restrictive intervention is used, it will be for as short a time as possible, and applied for no longer than the period of time that has been authorised. Its use will be reviewed frequently as per the relevant Behaviour Support Plan, and in accordance relevant legislative obligations.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>If a restrictive intervention is used, staff will record the details of the behaviour, the positive and reactive interventions tried prior to the restrictive intervention, the nature and duration of the restrictive intervention and the client&rsquo;s response to such.</li>\n<li>Where Restrictive interventions are used, they will be overseen by a specialist in behaviour and/or an allied health professional. A medical specialist will also oversee any restrictive intervention to identify any potential side effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Emergency Restrictive Interventions</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hi Five Community Services may use restrictive interventions in an emergency if they are of the opinion that there is an imminent risk of the person causing serious physical harm to themselves or others, and it is necessary to use a restrictive intervention to prevent that risk.</li>\n<li>If this happens, the intervention used must be the least restrictive as is possible in the circumstances, and applied in accordance with all other legislative requirements.</li>\n<li>After implementing any emergency restrictive intervention, staff will report the intervention immediately to the Director/Authorised Program Officer, who will report as soon as possible to the relevant state authority and/or appointed decision maker, as well as other relevant stakeholders.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Director responsibilities</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To ensure that clients who exhibit challenging behaviour have prioritised access to relevant professional services.</li>\n<li>To ensure that staff have access to relevant training and are able to demonstrate competence in supporting people who exhibit challenging behaviour.</li>\n<li>To ensure the regular review of behaviour interventions.</li>\n<li>To ensure that debriefing and counselling are available to people involved in critical incidents involving challenging behaviour, including family members, other clients and staff.</li>\n<li>To ensure that all relevant people are invited to participate in identifying the person&rsquo;s support needs, and an independent person is used, in line with legislative requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Staff Responsibilities</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To support the client in a way which promotes positive interactions.</li>\n<li>To support the development of the client by following all procedures as specified in the client&rsquo;s behaviour support plan.</li>\n<li>To prevent and protect individuals from harm (including harm to individuals through the destruction of property).</li>\n<li>To implement any necessary restrictive strategies as a last resort, and in a way that is least restrictive.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Record Keeping and Reporting</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Directors (or delegates) will record the use of positive interventions and strength based supports in line with the Records and Information Management Policy and Procedure.</li>\n<li>The Directors (or delegate) will report the use of restrictive interventions to the relevant state authority and/or appointed decision maker, in accordance with the relevant legislation and practice requirements.</li>\n<li>The Directors (or delegates) will report on the use of emergency restrictive interventions as soon as possible after they occur, in accordance with the relevant legislation and practice requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Monitoring and Review</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hi Five Community Services will review the use of restrictive interventions, along with an individual&rsquo;s behaviour support plan at least annually, or within a shorter timeframe where specified by the Authorised Program Officer or relevant state authority.
