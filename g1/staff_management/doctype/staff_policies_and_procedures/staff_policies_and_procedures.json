If abuse is disclosed, or a staff member is suspicious of abuse, or becomes aware of abuse, a helpful response may include:</li>\n<li>telling the person that you believe them;</li>\n<li>making it clear that whatever has happened is not their fault;</li>\n<li>reassuring the person who disclosed the abuse that they did the right thing;</li>\n<li>telling the person that some people do wrong things and that the perpetrator is responsible for the abuse; and</li>\n<li>doing everything possible to listen carefully to and reassure the person, including explaining the actions you will take next.</li>\n<li>When an allegation is made, a staff member suspects abuse or a staff member becomes aware of abuse, staff should immediately assess the situation to ensure a safe environment. Once safety is established, the first priority is to care for the client, and they must be given maximum support and assistance.</li>\n<li>Where a client or other Hi Five Community Services stakeholder is subject to any form of verbal or emotional abuse (including racism, discrimination or cultural abuse) from another client, Hi Five Community Services staff will consider terminating the perpetrator&rsquo;s service provision in accordance with Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Rights and Responsibilities Policy and Procedure.</li>\n<li>Any verbal, racism, discrimination or cultural abuse perpetrated by a staff member towards clients or other Hi Five Community Services stakeholders will be dealt with in accordance with the Disciplinary Action provisions in Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Human Resources Policy and Procedure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Responding to Abuse, Assault, Neglect or Unexplained absences</p>\n<p>First response</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the victim requires immediate medical attention, a medical practitioner or ambulance should be called, or the victim conveyed to the nearest hospital emergency department.</li>\n<li>Where a staff member is the alleged perpetrator of abuse, assault or neglect any medical practitioner called should be independent to Hi Five Community Services.</li>\n<li>The staff member who first becomes suspicious of abuse, and/or first becomes aware of the allegation or incident must report it as soon as practicable to the most senior staff member in the work area (where this person is not the suspected or alleged perpetrator). Where the senior staff member is the suspected or alleged perpetrator, the staff member must report as soon as practicable to the Director/s.</li>\n<li>The most senior staff member in the work area present at the time the allegation is made (or the Director/s) is responsible for reporting the allegation of assault to the Police.</li>\n<li>The report must be made as soon as practicable, once immediate safety and medical needs are met.</li>\n<li>The staff member who first suspects abuse or becomes aware of the allegation must be available to assist the Police with any investigation.</li>\n<li>All suspicions, allegations or assaults must be reported to the Directors immediately, or as soon as practicable.</li>\n<li>After reporting to the Police, every attempt must be made to ensure the safety of the victim and to prevent any further contact between the victim and the suspected or alleged perpetrator.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Compulsory reporting to Police</p>\n<p>Where the client:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>is a statutory child protection client;</li>\n<li>resides in out-of-home care;</li>\n<li>resides in a residential service directly managed by the NDIS Commission, such as youth justice custodial services, youth justice residential units, secure welfare, or disability accommodation services;</li>\n<li>receives direct service and supports by a registered disability service provider; or</li>\n<li>has a disability and is receiving in-home or community-based services and the allegation is against a staff member of either the Department or Hi Five Community Services;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And the incident is reportable under the relevant legislation, standards and guidelines and involves allegation of an assault of a:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>client by a staff member or volunteer;</li>\n<li>client by a client;</li>\n<li>client by a visitor, family member, other non-staff member or member of the community; or</li>\n<li>staff member, visitor, other non-staff member or member of the community by a client;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The allegation of assault must be reported to the police, whether or not the client has consented to the matter being reported. The client may choose not to participate in the police investigation.</p>\n<p>Where the client is under 18:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Directors (or delegates) must make a report to Child Protection as soon as is practicable after forming a belief, on reasonable grounds, that:</li>\n<li>a client is in need of protection from significant harm as a result of emotional, physical and/or sexual abuse, and/or neglect, and/or exposure to domestic violence and/or exploitation; and</li>\n<li>the client&rsquo;s parents/guardians are unwilling or unable to protect them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where staff hold a mandatory reporter role, they must report the abuse/neglect to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Police (by calling 000 - if the offence requires immediate police attention; or by calling the local police station); and</li>\n<li>Child Protection authorities, if they suspect, on reasonable grounds, that a child is suffering abuse or neglect, or wish to discuss their concerns about a child.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Advising parties involved of Police report</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In relation to a victim of assault, the staff member or volunteer who first becomes aware of the allegation must advise the person that the allegation will be reported to the police.</li>\n<li>In relation to an alleged perpetrator, staff should consult with police as to whether the person should be told of the report to police. It is important that any steps taken do not undermine action that police may instigate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dealing with the Police</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where an immediate police response is required, call 000.</li>\n<li>The phone call will result in the allocation of the appropriate response unit, which may be a Sexual Offence and Child Abuse Unit / Sexual Offences and Child Abuse Investigation Team (SOCAU/SOCIT) for the area, or a general duties police unit</li>\n<li>If the client is under the age of 18 years, a parent, guardian or independent person must be present if they are going to give a statement.</li>\n<li>At the time of contact, the Police must be advised if the client has an intellectual/cognitive impairment/disability or mental illness and needs support of an independent third person during the interview or when a statement is being taken.</li>\n<li>Where the client uses an alternative form of communication, such as symbols, signs or facilitated communication, an independent third person can usually assist the client to communicate with the police. It is the responsibility of the Police to contact the independent third person.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Contact the local Centre Against Sexual Assault</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Centre Against Sexual Assault (CASAs) operate throughout Vic and provide counselling, advocacy, support and information to adults, young people and children who have experienced sexual assault, whether they were children or adults when the assault was perpetrated. The 24 hour Sexual Assault Crisis Line can be contacted on 1800 806 292 from anywhere in the state and a duty worker will respond.</li>\n<li>In instances of alleged sexual assault, where the client consents, the most senior staff member in the work area should contact the local CAVIC at the same time the Police are informed of the allegation.</li>\n<li>The CAVIC should always be involved unless the client does not want contact with this service. Where the allegation is of sexual assault and the client is examined by a forensic medical officer or forensic nurse examiner, staff must ensure that the client is offered the assistance and support of a counsellor-advocate from the CASA.</li>\n<li>If the client is a person with a disability who does not have the capacity to consent, consent should be obtained from the person&rsquo;s guardian, where possible.</li>\n<li>CAVIC services are free and confidential to all victims/survivors of recent and past sexual assaults regardless of gender and include:</li>\n<li>immediate crisis support including crisis intervention, provision of information, counselling, advocacy, liaison with the department on child protection matters, police, forensic and other medical personnel, and coordination of support</li>\n<li>follow-up, longer-term counselling, advocacy and support</li>\n<li>information regarding options and rights within the legal system</li>\n<li>information regarding medical options, including follow-up medical treatment</li>\n<li>assistance to negotiate the management of sexually transmitted infections and/or pregnancy arising from the assault</li>\n<li>assistance in the management of other practical consequences of the assault such as emergency housing and compensation</li>\n<li>support and information to non-offending family members and support people.</li>\n<li>In addition to the above activities, CASAs also provide community education, training and specialist consultation services to relevant individuals and services to facilitate meeting the broader needs and concerns of victim/survivors of sexual assault. CAVIC can also arrange culturally-specific services for victims from culturally and linguistically diverse communities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Assisting the police</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The police should be assisted in conducting their investigation. The investigation may involve the police taking photographs of any physical injuries. The police may need the carer/worker&rsquo;s assistance to explain this procedure to the client.</li>\n<li>In relation to preserving evidence of sexual assault, it is helpful to:</li>\n<li>encourage the victim not to shower or change, or, if the victim feels they must shower or change, ask them to put the clothing they were wearing at the time of the assault in bags, which should be sealed, labelled and secured and</li>\n<li>where possible, lock the door to the room or restrict access to the area where the assault occurred so any physical evidence inside that area remains undisturbed.</li>\n<li>It is not necessary for a victim to decide immediately about whether to be involved in a police investigation and/or prosecution. People may be distraught in the immediate aftermath of an assault and sometimes change their minds later. Some evidence, however, will only be present in the immediate period following assault. Forensic evidence collected at this time will assist police investigation, should the victim wish to proceed at a later stage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where a client is the alleged victim</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where a client is the alleged victim of an assault, Hi Five Community Services staff must assist them to make an informed decision whether to participate in the police investigation. Staff should advise the client that the matter has been referred to the Police, that the Police may investigate the incident and may want to interview the client and take a statement. The client may choose whether or not to participate in the police investigation.</li>\n<li>Clients with an intellectual/cognitive impairment/disability or a mental illness must have an independent third person present during any interview. The role of the independent third person is to facilitate communication, ensure that the client understands his or her rights, and to support the client.</li>\n<li>Police are responsible for arranging the independent third person. Hi Five Community Services staff should not act as the independent third person.</li>\n<li>Where the alleged victim is under 18 years of age, he or she must have a parent, guardian or an independent person present when a statement is being taken. The role of the independent person is to provide support to the client, and ensure that their evidence is accurately recorded. If the young person has a cognitive disability, then an independent third person rather than an independent person should be present.</li>\n<li>The police will decide whether or not to proceed with charging.</li>\n<li>If the matter is taken to court, the client will most likely be required to give evidence.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Support and advocacy</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The response by staff to a client's disclosure of assault can be central to the client's ongoing safety and their recovery from the trauma of assault. Following an allegation of assault, it is important to:</li>\n<li>listen to and support the client;</li>\n<li>reassure the client that they did the right thing by talking about the assault;</li>\n<li>ensure the client&rsquo;s, and others&rsquo;, immediate safety, health and wellbeing needs are met such as obtaining medical attention and referral to other specialist/victim support services;</li>\n<li>ensure the client's specific support needs are addressed including access to communication aides and resources;</li>\n<li>tell the client what you plan to do next; and</li>\n<li>with the client&rsquo;s consent, engage family, significant others, an independent key support person and/or advocate to support the client and advocate on their behalf.</li>\n<li>A key support person may include a family member, significant other, or advocate who are independent of the perpetrator and/or service. The role of the key support person is to provide support and advocacy, and ensure client&rsquo;s rights are respected in relation to any subsequent investigation or action taken. A key support person should be someone who preferably knows the client well and has their trust.</li>\n<li>Specialist/victim support services may include crisis care, counselling, advocacy, legal information and advice.</li>\n<li>For clients who are from culturally and linguistically diverse communities or from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, staff should consider referring the client to specialist agencies or staff for additional support. It may also be necessary to arrange an interpreter. Appropriate services may include the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporation Family Violence Prevention and Legal Service or the Vic Aboriginal Health Service.</li>\n<li>Where the client uses a language other than English or is deaf, an interpreter of the same sex as the client should be arranged as soon as practicable to interpret for the client, police and other persons involved in the process. Contact the Interpreting and Translating Service.</li>\n<li>Some victims may be reluctant to speak to an interpreter because they fear that what they say may be passed on to their local community. In this case, it is possible to request a telephone interpreter from another state, or to not disclose the victim&rsquo;s name to the interpreter. When using an interpreter directly, consideration should be given to arranging an interpreter who is not associated with the client or his or her immediate cultural community.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Supporting client through the justice process</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hi Five Community Services will support clients through the justice process, including police investigation, prosecution and crimes compensation processes as appropriate. This may include:</li>\n<li>ensuring the client has access to appropriate communication aides and tools to facilitate disclosures and the provision of evidence;</li>\n<li>ensuring the client has access to a key support person of their choosing;</li>\n<li>alerting police to the need for an independent third person or independent person and the client's particular communication support needs, and the need for timely interviews to facilitate the recall of information;</li>\n<li>facilitating arrangements with police for interviews and examination of evidence; and</li>\n<li>facilitating arrangements with specialist support services.</li>\n<li>Under no circumstances should anyone but the Police interview the client about the allegation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where a client is the alleged perpetrator</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Staff must consult with Police about whether to inform the client of the report to Police. The police may want to interview the client and take a statement. Clients with an intellectual/cognitive impairment/disability and/or mental illness must have an independent third person present during the interview, and this will be arranged by police. Where the client is under the age of eighteen years, an independent person must be present during the police interview.</li>\n<li>Staff must contact the service most directly responsible for the client&rsquo;s care who will ensure that the client has legal representation and is assisted during the investigation and hearing.</li>\n<li>Under no circumstances should anyone but the Police interview the client about the allegation. It is acknowledged however that some discussion with the client may be required to establish safety and a basic understanding of what has occurred.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notification of next of kin or guardian &ndash; all clients</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the alleged perpetrator is the client&rsquo;s next of kin or legal guardian, the staff member must ensure that the immediate needs of the client and an appropriate planned response are undertaken.</li>\n<li>The Directors must notify the client&rsquo;s next of kin or guardian where:</li>\n<li>the client is under 18 years old;</li>\n<li>the client is over 18 years old and consents to their next of kin or guardian being contacted. If the client is unable to make an informed decision regarding contact and the client does not have an appointed guardian, Hi Five Community Services Coordinator should contact the next of kin as appropriate;</li>\n<li>the client has a legal guardian;</li>\n<li>The client is on a guardianship to Secretary order</li>\n<li>The Directors must explain to the next of kin or guardian: the nature of the allegation; the standard procedure for reporting allegations to the Police; that the client may choose whether or not to participate in the Police investigation; and any action taken by staff since reporting the allegation.</li>\n<li>If the client is a child or young person who does not wish their next of kin or guardian to be notified, a decision in relation to notification will need to consider factors including the client&rsquo;s age and capacity, where they are living and their best interests. If necessary, legal advice should be sought, and if a decision is taken not to notify the next of kin or guardian, this must be clearly documented and placed on the client&rsquo;s file.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ongoing support</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Irrespective of gender, victims of sexual assault frequently experience negative outcomes including dissociation, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety. Victims of physical assault also frequently experience shock, numbness, fear, depression and anxiety. In recognition of this, after an allegation of abuse, additional support and/or a review of supports provided to the client may be required.</li>\n<li>A quality of support review must also be undertaken by a Director for clients who are victims or alleged perpetrators of an assault. Agreed actions for the client&rsquo;s immediate and ongoing needs must be recorded on the client&rsquo;s care plan. This must include:</li>\n<li>steps being taken to assure the client&rsquo;s safety and wellbeing in the future</li>\n<li>treatment or counselling the client may access to address their safety and wellbeing</li>\n<li>modifications in the way services are provided (for example, same gender care or placement)</li>\n<li>how best to support the client through any action the client takes to seek justice or redress including making a report to Police</li>\n<li>any ongoing risk management strategy required where this is deemed appropriate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>External Reporting</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Director/s must report any allegation or assault of a person with a disability to the NDIS Commission, and when doing so, should refer to the Department&rsquo;s Critical Client Incident Management Instruction to determine when a report is required and how to complete the report.</li>\n<li>The Department has established a protocol for the provision of client incident reports relating to allegations of staff to client assault or unexplained injuries within disability services to the Disability Services Commissioner for independent monitoring, review and advice on client specific issues and trends.</li>\n<li>The Department also has an established protocol with the Commission for Children and Young People for the provision of client incident reports for children in out of home care. The Commission monitors critical incidents reports to identify any emerging or recurring themes, trends and issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Staff and client debrief and support</p>\n<ul>\n<li>After a serious and traumatic incident, it is likely that high levels of stress will be experienced by those connected with the incident.</li>\n<li>In relation to a sexual assault, the local CAVIC can provide assistance with debriefing and secondary consultation.</li>\n<li>General arrangements to support staff may include allocating a safe place for retreat, giving staff the option of being immediately and temporarily relieved of their duties, providing communication with families and offering to organise transport home.</li>\n<li>General arrangements to support clients may include allocating a safe place for retreat and communicating with families.</li>\n<li>Clients have a right to complain about Hi Five Community Services services and they and their key support person/advocate should be alerted to Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Feedback, Compliments and Complaints Policy and Procedure and external complaints bodies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where a staff member is the alleged perpetrator</p>\n<ul>\n<li>After reporting to the Police, the Directors must be immediately notified of the report.</li>\n<li>Depending on the nature of the allegation, the Directors&rsquo; response regarding the alleged perpetrator should comply with Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Human Resources Policy and Procedure. Responses include redirecting the staff member to alternate duties that do not involve direct client care, standing the staff member down and/or reporting them to the Disability Worker Exclusion Scheme Unit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where a staff member is the alleged victim</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allegations or assaults where a Hi Five Community Services staff member is the alleged victim should be dealt with in accordance with Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Incident Management Policy and Procedure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Monitoring and Review</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; service delivery and satisfaction surveys will assess:</li>\n<li>client and other stakeholder awareness of their rights and the extent to which they feel able and supported to exercise them;</li>\n<li>client and other stakeholder satisfaction with Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; complaints processes; and</li>\n<li>the extent to which clients feel safe and protected in their dealings with Hi Five Community Services.</li>\n<li>Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Continuous Improvement Plan will be used to record and monitor progress of any improvements identified.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>This Policy and Procedure will be reviewed at least annually by Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Management Team.

In this policy, it includes substitute decision-makers appointed under the former Enduring Power of Guardianship and Medical Power of Attorney.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><u>Policy</u></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hi Five Community Services is committed to ensuring all clients are involved in making decisions and exercising choice and control over all aspects of the support services they receive from the organisation.</li>\n<li>In the first instance, clients should be the person making informed decisions and choices with regard to themselves and the services they receive.</li>\n<li>All people have the right to maintain their personal, gender, sexual, cultural, religious and spiritual identity, and the right to dignity of risk. They also have the right to maintain their independence in physical, intellectual, emotional, cultural, social, civic and financial matters.</li>\n<li>Hi Five Community Services will respect each participant&rsquo;s autonomy in their right to intimacy and sexual expression.</li>\n<li></li>\n<li>The client will be offered a minimum of two weeks period for them to decide at any stage of supports provision, including assessment, planning, provision review and exit for any decision to be made. In this time, they can ask questions, make enquiries etc. to support them in making decision.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><u>Communication in client&rsquo;s preferred language</u></p>\n<p>We respect the right of the client to communicate in their preferred language. In the clients intake assessment, client or their legal nominee will be asked of their preferred language for verbal and written communication. Whichever language they prefer will be adapted in service delivery to the client as well as in providing them information and resourced in their preferred language.</p>\n<p><u>Principles</u></p>\n<p>Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Directors (or delegates) will ensure all staff are familiar with the following principles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All adults have the right to make their own decisions.</li>\n<li>Some clients will have an independent support person, representative, family member or advocate to assist them to make a decision or choice, or make a choice on their behalf.</li>\n<li>A representative or person responsible is not necessarily the client&rsquo;s next of kin. A representative or person responsible can be:</li>\n<li>a spouse, carer or close relative or friend (informal guardian).</li>\n<li>If a person is unable to make decisions because of disability or impairment, a guardian or administrator can be appointed to make decisions for them.</li>\n<li>A guardian can make personal and lifestyle decisions on another&rsquo;s behalf.</li>\n<li>An advocate can be a family member, friend or an independent person from a community organisation.

Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Authorised Program Officer is Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Directors.</p>\n<p>Behaviours of concern - any behaviour by a person using Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; services which could cause physical harm to themselves or other people, or which could cause property damage that could lead to themselves or other people being hurt.</p>\n<p>Behaviour Support Plan - A plan developed for a person with a disability that specifies a range of strategies to be used in supporting the person's behaviour, including proactive strategies to build on the person's strengths and increase their life skills. Any person who is subjected to restraint and/or seclusion in disability services must have an approved Behaviour Support Plan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Restrictive intervention &ndash; defined by the relevant legislation as any intervention that is used to restrict the rights or freedom of movement of a person with a disability including chemical, mechanical, physical restraint, and seclusion. The legislation also refers to other restrictive interventions, which include, but are not limited to, environmental restraint, psycho-social restraint and consequence-driven strategies.</p>\n<p>Chemical restraint - the use, for the primary purpose of the behavioural control of a person with a disability, of a chemical substance to control or subdue the person. Does not include the use of a drug prescribed by a registered medical practitioner for the treatment, or to enable the treatment, of a mental illness or a physical illness or physical condition.</p>\n<p>Mechanical restraint - the use, for the primary purpose of the behavioural control of a person with a disability, of devices to prevent, restrict or subdue a person's movement. Does not include the use of devices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>for therapeutic purposes; or</li>\n<li>to enable the safe transportation of the person.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Seclusion - the sole confinement of a person with a disability at any hour of the day or night:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in any room in the premises where disability services are being provided of which the doors and windows cannot be opened by the person from the inside; or</li>\n<li>in any room in the premises where disability services are being provided of which the doors and windows are locked from the outside; or</li>\n<li>to a part of any premises in which disability services are being provided.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Senior Practitioner &ndash; in accordance with the relevant legislation, this is the person appointed by the relevant Government to ensure that people&rsquo;s rights are protected and that service providers follow legislative and practice standards any time restrictive interventions are used.</p>\n<p>Detention - a situation where a person who wishes to do so is actively prevented from leaving the place where they receive disability services. Detention may include locked doors, windows or gates, and the constant supervision and escorting of a person to prevent them from exercising freedom of movement.</p>\n<p>Environmental restraint &ndash; the prevention, including but not limited to the use of physical or other barriers, of a person&rsquo;s free access to all parts of their environment for the purpose of influencing or controlling that person&rsquo;s behaviour. This includes locking cupboard and doors, being prevented access to anything in the kitchen and restrictions to personal items, locks being used that a person has difficulty accessing or cannot self-operate, and restrictions to engaging in social activities (such as a person not being supported to leave the house when they wants to, regardless of operational demands).</p>\n<p>Exclusion - the act of preventing a person from participating in or being part of an activity or decision, or deliberately ignoring or not including a person in an activity or decision.</p>\n<p>Guardian - a person appointed as guardian of an adult by legal order of the relevant state institution, usually where a person has been deemed as having impaired decision-making capacity. A guardian is responsible for making decisions on behalf of a person about accommodation and/or health care and/or lifestyle matters and/or restrictive interventions.</p>\n<p>Impaired decision-making capacity refers to the inability of a person to make a particular decision at a particular time because he or she is incapable of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>understanding any information that may be relevant to the decision; or</li>\n<li>retaining such information; or</li>\n<li>using such information in the course of making the decision; or</li>\n<li>communicating his or her decision in any manner; or</li>\n<li>by reason of being comatose or otherwise unconscious, is unable to make a particular decision about his or her medical treatment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Substitute decision-maker - an adult appointed under a Gentle Care Support Service directive who can make decisions about health care, end of life, living arrangements and other personal matters on behalf of a person during a period of impaired decision-making capacity, whether for a short time or permanently. In this policy, it includes substitute decision-makers appointed under the former Enduring Power of Guardianship and Medical Power of Attorney.</p>\n<p>Mechanical restraint - the use of a device to prevent, restrict or subdue a person&rsquo;s free movement for the primary purpose of influencing or controlling that person&rsquo;s behaviour. Mechanical restraint does not include the use of devices for therapeutic purposes (eg splints) or for safety purposes not primarily related to behaviour (eg seat belts, bed rails to prevent injury from falls, devices to enable the safe transportation of a person). However, a therapeutic or safety device is considered a mechanical restraint if a person resists or objects to its use, or if it prevents free movement upon its use for safety or therapeutic services ceasing (ie where a bed rail prevents a person from getting out of bed as soon as they want to).</p>\n<p>Physical restraint - the use of any part of a person&rsquo;s body to prevent, restrict or subdue free movement of another person&rsquo;s body for the primary purpose of controlling that person&rsquo;s behaviour. Physical restraint does not include brief physical contact to guide or redirect a person away from immediate potential harm or injury consistent with a service provider&rsquo;s duty of care to that person or physical assistance with activities of daily living. This type of restraint can only be used as a planned response in emergency situations, and is not to be used as a part of a person&rsquo;s routine behaviour support.</p>\n<p>PRN medication (PRN - &lsquo;pro-re-nata&rsquo;) - medication that is given as needed or as the situation arises (i.e. the times of administration are determined by the needs of the person and not given at scheduled times, e.g. analgesia for pain or fever). PRN may be considered as being a chemical restraint (see definition of chemical restraint).</p>\n<p>Psycho-social restraint &ndash; the use of power-control strategies to influence a person&rsquo;s behaviour. This includes but is not limited to directing the person&rsquo;s behaviour through voice tone, commands or threats and the use of punishment, including ignoring the person and withholding basic human rights, such as positive social interaction, personal belongings or a favoured activity. It also includes directions to: stay in one area of the house or the use of &lsquo;exclusionary time-out&rsquo;; and remain in a particular position, and the over-correction of errors.</p>\n<p>Restrictive practices - any practice, device or action that removes or restricts another person&rsquo;s freedom, movement or ability to make a decision. This includes, but is not limited to, detention, seclusion, exclusion, aversive restraint, chemical restraint, physical restraint, mechanical restraint, environmental restraint, psycho-social restraint and the consequence-driven strategies. Restrictive practices do not include therapeutic or safety devices/practices, where the device or practice is being used for its intended purpose and the person is not resisting or objecting to its use.</p>\n<p>Safety device/practice - a device or practice used for safety purposes not primarily related to behaviour (e.g. lap belts or bed rails to prevent accidental falls or devices to enable the safe transportation of a person). This also includes environmental modifications for safety purposes, such as sensor mats and &lsquo;Walkabout&rsquo; alarms.</p>\n<p>Therapeutic device/practice - a device or practice recommended by an appropriate health practitioner for the purpose of maintaining or restoring health or for the treatment of an illness or condition (e.g. splints).</p>\n<p><u>Policy</u></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hi Five Community Services promotes the dignity, worth, rights and developmental potential of people with a disability.

Strategies include:</li>\n<li>inclusive, person-centred approaches in all instances of support;</li>\n<li>proactively preventing behaviours of concern occurring in the first place;</li>\n<li>working to the primary goal of enhancing the quality of life of a person and a secondary goal of reducing behaviours of concern;</li>\n<li>taking into consideration the context in which any behaviours of concern occur and the environments in which the person lives;</li>\n<li>seeing the person&rsquo;s strengths and being committed to the person&rsquo;s potential;</li>\n<li>valuing the person and seeing the behaviour in context;</li>\n<li>an appreciation that all behaviours have a purpose; and</li>\n<li>being positive.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Hi Five Community Services Directors (or delegates) will discuss how best to manage behaviours of concern with the client and their supporter/s.</li>\n<li>In managing behaviour, staff will always use the least restrictive alternative. Any action taken to benefit a client should intrude as little as possible on their rights and lifestyle.</li>\n<li>Restrictive interventions, including those that constitute environmental restraint, psycho-social restraint, consequence-driven strategies or exclusion are inconsistent with rights-based and person-centred service delivery to people with disability and must not be recommended or used in any circumstances, unless used in accordance with relevant legislation.</li>\n<li>Staff will implement Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; NDIS Assessment, Planning and Review Policy and Procedure consistent with this policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Individual Behaviour Support Plans</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The plans of people subject to restrictive interventions must include (but should not be limited to) the following key quality elements in relation to positive behaviour support:</li>\n<li>The plan identifies the function of the behaviours of concern</li>\n<li>Environmental factors that trigger or support the behaviours of concern are identified</li>\n<li>The plan introduces environmental change and supports positive behaviour</li>\n<li>Reinforcement schedules relating to positive behaviour</li>\n<li>Description of the response to recurrence of behaviours of concern</li>\n<li>A strategy to communicate between relevant persons.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Hi Five Community Services may seek the expertise of psychologists and/or developmental educators and/or other allied health professionals in the development and implementation of individual support plans, in accordance with relevant legislative requirements.</li>\n<li>An appropriate individual behaviour support plan must be in place before a restrictive practice is recommended.</li>\n<li>Directors (or delegates) are to be advised and trained in the individual support plan, which must be readily available in the person&rsquo;s file for ongoing use by staff when required.</li>\n<li>Hi Five Community Services is required to ensure that a person&rsquo;s specific consent and/or authorisation arrangements, including the details of a person&rsquo;s substitute decision-maker or guardian, or any orders by the relevant Public Guardianship authority are clearly documented to inform Directors (or delegates) about arrangements relating to the use of restrictive practices.</li>\n<li>Disability service providers are responsible for accurate recording and reporting of the use of restrictive practices. This includes:</li>\n<li>Maintaining a register of all people who have an individual support plan that includes the use of restrictive practices;</li>\n<li>Recording each use of a restrictive practice; and&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Recording each use of a restrictive practice in an emergency.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Restrictive Interventions</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hi Five Community Services in principle does not support the use of restrictive interventions.</li>\n<li>Restrictive interventions restrict the liberty of individuals and should be considered only in exceptional circumstances where a person is at imminent risk of causing physical harm to themselves or others (including harm to self or others through the destruction of property), and all other reasonable, less restrictive alternatives have been used. In these rare instances, the use of restrictive interventions must be an option of last resort. It must be time-limited, based on best practice, applied in line with the relevant legislative requirements and be the least restrictive option available in the situation.</li>\n<li>Should Hi Five Community Services need to implement restrictive interventions, the organisation will uphold its obligations in accordance with the relevant legislation. This includes consultation with the client, their supporter/s and other key stakeholders, including appointed decision makers, to develop a Behaviour Support Plan prior to the use of any restrictive interventions</li>\n<li>The use of a restrictive interventions within Hi Five Community Services requires the following:</li>\n<li>Comprehensive bio-psychosocial assessment;</li>\n<li>Recommendation of the restrictive intervention by an appropriate professional, within the context of a holistic individual behaviour support plan for the person with disability, in line with legislative requirements;</li>\n<li>Informed consent by a person with legal authority;</li>\n<li>Where required, authorisation by the relevant government institution;</li>\n<li>Application of the restrictive intervention only by appropriately trained and competent disability services staff, to the extent legally authorised; and</li>\n<li>Regular review of the use of the restrictive interventions as part of individual support planning with the person, in accordance with timeframes set out in relevant legislation.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Within Hi Five Community Services, the use of a restrictive practice requires recommendation by:</li>\n<li>a practitioner, being a medical practitioner, relevant health professional or manager of the relevant service unit or area; and</li>\n<li>Directors, and</li>\n<li>Any other appropriate person, according to legislative requirements.</li>\n<li>The primary focus of any Behaviour Support Plan will be to improve the quality of life of the client, with a secondary focus on eliminating or reducing behaviours of concern. Restrictive interventions approved for use, will be used only:</li>\n<li>when necessary to prevent the person from causing physical harm to themselves or others (including harm to self or others through the destruction of property);</li>\n<li>in a way that is least restrictive;</li>\n<li>as a last resort;</li>\n<li>in accordance with the individual&rsquo;s behaviour support plan;</li>\n<li>applied for the period of time that has been authorised; and</li>\n<li>in accordance with all relevant legislative requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>For each client that restrictive interventions apply to, the restrictive practices will not be implemented until that client&rsquo;s Behaviour Support Plan is approved by the Authorised Program Officer and until the client subject to the restrictive interventions has been notified in writing at least two days prior to the proposed use of the practices, except in the case of an emergency.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Notification will be in an accessible communication format for the client and advise that a restrictive intervention has been approved for use and under what conditions. Clients subject to restrictive intervention and their supporters will be made aware of the reasons restrictive interventions may be implemented and when and how this will be reviewed. In accordance with relevant legislation, an independent person must be availed of to complete this task.</li>\n<li>Before any restrictive intervention is used, the Director (or delegates) will ensure the person exhibiting behaviours of concern and their supporter/s (if applicable), understand they have the right to appeal to the relevant authority if they do not agree with the intervention.</li>\n<li>If a client does not have a supporter or guardian and is unable to advocate for themselves, staff will make sure the person is supported to access an advocate (see Hi Five Community Services&rsquo; Decision Making and Choice Policy and Procedure).</li>\n<li>Restrictive interventions will not be used until such time that Hi Five Community Services have procedures in place that detail the specific application of the restriction (e.g. specific procedures as to how physical restraint will be safely and legally applied in the relevant setting).</li>\n<li>No individual will apply a restriction without the appropriate training in the safe use of the restriction, the legal framework and obligations, and the risks posed by the use of the restriction. The Director (or delegates) must be satisfied of staff&rsquo;s competence in the practice prior to its use.</li>\n<li>Any use of a restrictive intervention must be approved by the Directors (or delegates), the Authorised Program Officer and any other relevant person in accordance with the legislative requirements, except in situations where there is significant risk of someone being harmed.</li>\n<li>If a restrictive intervention is used, it will be for as short a time as possible, and applied for no longer than the period of time that has been authorised. Its use will be reviewed frequently as per the relevant Behaviour Support Plan, and in accordance relevant legislative obligations.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>If a restrictive intervention is used, staff will record the details of the behaviour, the positive and reactive interventions tried prior to the restrictive intervention, the nature and duration of the restrictive intervention and the client&rsquo;s response to such.</li>\n<li>Where Restrictive interventions are used, they will be overseen by a specialist in behaviour and/or an allied health professional. A medical specialist will also oversee any restrictive intervention to identify any potential side effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Emergency Restrictive Interventions</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hi Five Community Services may use restrictive interventions in an emergency if they are of the opinion that there is an imminent risk of the person causing serious physical harm to themselves or others, and it is necessary to use a restrictive intervention to prevent that risk.</li>\n<li>If this happens, the intervention used must be the least restrictive as is possible in the circumstances, and applied in accordance with all other legislative requirements.</li>\n<li>After implementing any emergency restrictive intervention, staff will report the intervention immediately to the Director/Authorised Program Officer, who will report as soon as possible to the relevant state authority and/or appointed decision maker, as well as other relevant stakeholders.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Director responsibilities</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To ensure that clients who exhibit challenging behaviour have prioritised access to relevant professional services.</li>\n<li>To ensure that staff have access to relevant training and are able to demonstrate competence in supporting people who exhibit challenging behaviour.</li>\n<li>To ensure the regular review of behaviour interventions.</li>\n<li>To ensure that debriefing and counselling are available to people involved in critical incidents involving challenging behaviour, including family members, other clients and staff.</li>\n<li>To ensure that all relevant people are invited to participate in identifying the person&rsquo;s support needs, and an independent person is used, in line with legislative requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Staff Responsibilities</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To support the client in a way which promotes positive interactions.</li>\n<li>To support the development of the client by following all procedures as specified in the client&rsquo;s behaviour support plan.</li>\n<li>To prevent and protect individuals from harm (including harm to individuals through the destruction of property).</li>\n<li>To implement any necessary restrictive strategies as a last resort, and in a way that is least restrictive.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Record Keeping and Reporting</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Directors (or delegates) will record the use of positive interventions and strength based supports in line with the Records and Information Management Policy and Procedure.</li>\n<li>The Directors (or delegate) will report the use of restrictive interventions to the relevant state authority and/or appointed decision maker, in accordance with the relevant legislation and practice requirements.</li>\n<li>The Directors (or delegates) will report on the use of emergency restrictive interventions as soon as possible after they occur, in accordance with the relevant legislation and practice requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Monitoring and Review</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hi Five Community Services will review the use of restrictive interventions, along with an individual&rsquo;s behaviour support plan at least annually, or within a shorter timeframe where specified by the Authorised Program Officer or relevant state authority.
